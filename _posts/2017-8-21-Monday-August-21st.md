## Solar Eclipse Day

- Today there is a total Solar Eclipse; too bad I'm in California..won't see the entire thing.
  However, there *is* a livestream, courtesy NASA! My mentor booked his ticket to Ohio
  about 4 months ago, because well...geek LOL.
  
## Finished my third assignment for my Nanodegree

- Got this response, which was really encouraging!

## Also...went sailing!

- We made it all the way to Malibu, and saw dolphins!

## A race was going on...

- The powerboat in the middle is usually the officiating boat.

## These guys were flying overhead

- We had an air force vet on board, so he told us what it was.
  I'm not that savvy, although I know a *few* planes (like the A-10, etc).

## I had to take a photo...

- This is the name of a classmate of mine from high school!
  Yeah, so I went to a predominantly East-Indian descent high school...

## Kata solved

- Smallest value of an array

```
def find_smallest(numbers,to_return):
  try:
      if to_return == "value":
          a = sorted(numbers)
          #print a[0]
          return a[0]
      elif to_return == "index":
          a = sorted(numbers)
          b = a[0]
          #print numbers.index(b)
          return numbers.index(b)
      else:
          #print None
          return None
  except:
      #print None
      return None
```
