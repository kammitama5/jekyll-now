## GSoC Day 60

## Today was a day of JavaScript and Type-checking.
 - I specifically learned some things about how a type-checker works.
   I also learned about building type-checked languages with 
   [Turnstile](https://docs.racket-lang.org/turnstile/The_Turnstile_Guide.html#%28part._judgements%29).
 - [Stephen Chang](https://github.com/stchang) gave us a talk on PL, type-checking and an introduction to macrotypes.
 - I got my type-checker to implement ```Ints```, ```Floats```, ```Bools``` and ```Strings```. I still need to implement
   ```Lambdas``` properly. Then I need to implement that in Turnstile.
   
## The highlight of the day
 - Was that Matthias said he'd chat with those who were interested in pursuing a PhD in PL. He described the average
   Bachelor's as kind of a shallow experience. I went in a little later, so my experience was quite different, but
   I do notice that a lot of people come out not very well-rounded or worldly. He mentioned that a student he knew
   actually found out he liked wood-carving more than dependent types for Assembly. Sometimes, that's how things work out.
   
 - He mentioned that the goal is to find a Master for whom you can be an apprentice. Someone who is willing to help
   you work on your deficiencies, essentially. He also outlined the options and reasons for doing a PhD. He described
   a PhD as sort of like "falling in love"; the honeymoon stage, and how that is the sort of feeling that carries you
   through when things get difficult while study. It reminded me of college, where an advisor told me that I should do
   something that I love, because the first time I experienced a lot of snow and was miserable and homesick, the love
   and grit for wanting to be there would carry me emotionally.
   
## Why do a PhD?
 - Why would you want to learn from someone? You like their ideas. You get along with that person. Be sure that's who
   you'd want to work with for say, five years. Make sure they give you room to try several things, and that you
   aren't limited by one specific type of restricted research based on funding. 
 - He described the papers you publish as milestones of tackling problems, every three years or so. Then there's a
   "hump paper", after which you can write your dissertation. He also mentioned that two to three years before you
   are ready to go before the committee, you should know where you want to end up and your advisor should help you
   achieve those goals or set you on that path. Very helpful advice.
   
## I got back in time
 - To pair-programme with Chris on getting the window to be resizable so it isn't hiding the controls on my tiny 
   screen. A lot of it was fiddling with ```css`` and even writing a bit of ```jquery```. The difference between
   that and reasoning about Haskell is *very* different. Plus, I didn't have to rebuild or anything because of the
   automatic reload with CSS. So it was a welcome break.
   
## I guess it's back to Haskell!
 - I'm going to spend the time reasoning about some Haskell in ```CIS194```, which I've been going through on my
   own. I also looked at some parser code today written in Haskell. I think I can make a small parser!
