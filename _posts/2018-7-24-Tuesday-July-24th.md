## GSoC Day 72 and ICFP news!

## Was tired today
- But today turned out fine. I made some fixes for a pull request that I had outstanding.
  I like people who are picky with their pull requests. As I'm learning, it helps me more
  when people are picky about whitespace and things lining up exactly and that sort of thing.
- So far, that PR passed one set of continuous integration tests, and it's running through
  another as I write this.
  
## The historySlider works!
- I have to say, it also looks pretty *sick* :)

- Chris wants the spacing to look more like 
```[A] [-----B-----] [C]      [D] [-----E-----] [F]```
  but I'm going to wait on that one because people are picky about their spacing.
  That's very much a kind of UI-to taste type thing. I did make the slider say x so there
  is less ambiguity about what the ```speedSlider``` is doing.
  
## Other than that
 - Great news! I got in as a student volunteer for ICFP!!! :)
   I'm definitely psyched! So looking forward to attending!!!
