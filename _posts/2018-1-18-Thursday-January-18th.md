## SQL Blues and Data Things

## Hi All!
- I've been working through my Data Nanodegree. I really enjoyed the A/B Testing and Logistic Regression 
  stuff, which is near the end. 
- However, I've been since going over some of the middle-coursework, and realized I need to spend a bit more 
  time learning SQL for Data Science, so I'm doing that today. I want it to be better at it so it's second-nature.
  I've been told that I have a strength of pattern-matching, but the linear style of SQL is not as second-nature
  for me to grasp (the simple SQL is easy for me, but the more complicated logic takes a bit more time for me to 
  grasp), particularly as a lot of SQL is not as visual as say, Jupyter's/ Python's format/ interface.
  
## So far otherwise
- I was accepted to two bootcamps, and turned one down (they're sort of my back-up but I didn't want to
  do the purely JS one), am studying for GREs and am interviewing and waiting to hear back on some applications
  for summer internships.
  I also have heard from some other recruiters, so I've applied for some of that stuff, too. But honestly,
  I really just want to do my Master's, the more I think about it. 
  
## Particularly
- I was listening to SPJ's podcast and the excitement of [Programmes as Proofs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/functional-programming-languages-pursuit-laziness-dr-simon-peyton-jones/)
  . A friend of mine was talking to me yesterday about the sort of disappointment that there isn't more attention paid in the industry
  to correctness, and I don't think if I start working right away I'd be exposed to a lot of that. 
- If I am able to get into a program, I'd be allowed to focus on correctness, which I think would serve me in a good way. 
  I honestly don't care for someone lauding over me that they "have more experience" because they've just written a bunch of buggy code,
  as much as I do people who can teach me to write better, cleaner, more succinct and correct code. That's sort of the Holy Grail for me.
  
## Here are some things I was playing around with
