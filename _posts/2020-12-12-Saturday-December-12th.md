## Making a language

## I took a class
- I took a [class](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/language-construction-workshop/26) taught by this amazing [software engineer and linguist](https://colingorrie.com/about) where we made a language in six weeks. 
- Then, we presented our translation of the same poem based on the language.
- Mine is inspired by Hindi and Armenian and is VSO. Other VSO languages are  Irish, Mayan and some other Polynesian languages.


## Poem
```
On a hill, a sheep that did not have wool saw horses.
kŋ <ng> kaa tshaa-ŋ-aŋ tsaani tschaa saat-o kaabkh-i

One horse pulled a heavy wagon.
ŋ <ng> tsc aa-o u-ŋ kaabkh tschgaa

One horse carried a big load.
ŋ <ng> tsc aa-o u-ŋ aa-tng-ak vtkaa zaa-k

One horse carried a person.
ŋ <ng> tsc aa-o u-ŋ aa-tng-ak pvkka

The sheep said to the horses:
kah-ao (pl) tschaak a-k kaabkh-i

“I grieve when I see a person who drives horses.”
ŋ <ng> ŋklhhh saat-ak brt-ŋ kaabkh(-an)-i pvkka

The horses said:
kaa-o kaabkh(-an)-i

We grieve when we see this:
ŋ <ng>-o ŋklhhh saat-o

"A person takes the wool of the sheep and makes a warm garment with it.
trrda pvkka tschaa-tsaani t-a-k-b-r̥ kvtaa ŋ-ts-z-a tshaa

And the sheep does not have wool."
tsaani tschaa aa-tk ŋ-aŋ

When the sheep heard this, it fled into the plain.
ŋ-k-lhhh tch-aa-r̥-tch-o kah-ao (pl) ŋ rrh udvnn ŋ <ng> khh
```

## That's it
