## Last day at LambdaConf

## Today was the last official day of the talks for the conference.

- We have a few social events tomorrow. I'll be going to the high tea.
  
- It's been bittersweet, because this has been such a *great* conference.
 
- It's so sad; the people for this event come from all over; 
  I was talking to one friend who I swear lived on the West Coast.
  I thought he was from the Bay area. As it turns out, he lives in Boston.
  
- In any case, I definitely plan to attend next year!
