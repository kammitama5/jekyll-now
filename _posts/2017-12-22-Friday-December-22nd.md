## Scraping the Internet

## Space things...

- I attended the German club last night, and it was Amaaaaazing! (nope, [cat didn't walk over my keyboard!](https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/3909)). Specifically, my friend who works on Electronic components testing
  was there; he's been hired full-time at JPL! I also discovered I've been talking to a lady I may have met before 
  in 2016, when I was at JPL for my four-day workshop. We gave her a ride home yesterday evening, and 2 and 2 came 
  together. Hmm! 
- I also met a roboticist who is working on co-axial drones for Titan! He was amazing to speak with, and I immediately
  lit up, and before we knew it, the entire table was talking about ways to solve problems with drone technologies,
  and challenges, and different planetary atmospheres. It was really incredible! It was a really fun night!

## Oh yeah..Hi all!

- Been working through my Nanodegree today, and went through the Python module.
  It was actually pretty rough, but worth it. 
  I say "rough", because it seemed to hit upon *all* my weaknesses, so I know 
  what I need to practice now, particularly for data analysis.
- I've sort of been cheating and using things like lists to avoid dictionaries,
  and that sort of thing. But for data analysis, you def need to know your dictionaries,
  hash-maps, and tuples. 
- That being said, I got to the end of the Python module and came across web scraping,
  which is *amazing*. I don't know why in the past I relegated it in my mind to "chatbot",
  which is relegated to a part of my mind that is labelled "refuse knowledge", because 
  man, it is fun! 
- I enjoyed it so much (even though it was just a taste, and for the project we'll be using it!)
  that I searched and found this [book](http://zempirians.com/ebooks/Ryan%20Mitchell-Web%20Scraping%20with%20Python_%20Collecting%20Data%20from%20the%20Modern%20Web-O'Reilly%20Media%20(2015).pdf)
  on webscraping in Python, and decided to go through all 256 pages!

## So far

- I'm learning how to parse html on pages and find text, tags and other such useful information. 
  For example, this is a little script I made to find all the images on one of the [author](https://github.com/REMitchell)'s webpages
  and output the number of images on that page.

## Upcoming

- I'm working on project 1 this weekend, which involves some SQL and possibly Excel
- Next week, since I've already completed the Python module, I'll spend on either
  (if I don't complete the project this weekend) finishing up that project and working
  on project 2. I'll also dig into the next module, which is Data Analysis. After that,
  there's a project and Statistics coursework. 
- We're using Jupyter substantially after that, which is great!
- I'm also working on another Python Data Analysis course simultaneously, that is just 
  about four weeks long. It doesn't officially open until tomorrow, but I have done 
  week one's quiz already. 
- There's a PureScript Meeting tomorrow online. I'll be sure to attend that. I keep 
  getting roped into these functional-ly things. I actually saw a Quora question a 
  while ago that a student posted, where they couldn't decide between Python, Haskell
  and JavaScript, and asked which two they should learn. I secretly said "Python and Haskell"
  and one of the persons answering OP said "if you want to be a data scientist, Python and Haskell".
  And I went "huh...", and smiled (those happen to be the two dream languages, with some C++ thrown in!) :D
