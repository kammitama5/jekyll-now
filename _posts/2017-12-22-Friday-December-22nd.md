## Scraping the Internet

## Hi all

- Been working through my Nanodegree today, and went through the Python module.
  It was actually pretty rough, but worth it. 
  I say "rough", because it seemed to hit upon *all* my weaknesses, so I know 
  what I need to practice now, particularly for data analysis.
- I've sort of been cheating and using things like lists to avoid dictionaries,
  and that sort of thing. But for data analysis, you def need to know your dictionaries,
  hash-maps, and tuples. 
- That being said, I got to the end of the Python module and came across web scraping,
  which is *amazing*. I don't know why in the past I relegated it in my mind to "chatbot",
  which is relegated to a part of my mind that is labelled "refuse knowledge", because 
  man, it is fun! 
- I enjoyed it so much (even though it was just a taste, and for the project we'll be using it!)
  that I searched and found this [book](http://zempirians.com/ebooks/Ryan%20Mitchell-Web%20Scraping%20with%20Python_%20Collecting%20Data%20from%20the%20Modern%20Web-O'Reilly%20Media%20(2015).pdf)
  on webscraping in Python, and decided to go through all 256 pages!

## So far

- I'm learning how to parse html on pages and find text, tags and other such useful information. 
  For example, this is a little script I made to find all the images on one of the [author](https://github.com/REMitchell)'s webpages
  and output the number of images on that page.
