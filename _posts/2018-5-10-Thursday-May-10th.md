## IO Day 2

## Yeah..nothing unusual at all...
- Just kidding! :D
- Apparently, it was so huge this year (7000 people) that they brought in drivers from Vegas. 

## Anyways...
- One of the highlights for me was that I got to visit a friend at X.

- I got a mini-tour, got to do a self-driving car demo (obviously can't talk about that)
  and had chocolate soft-serve ice cream with alcohol in it...I think? :D
- I also saw Astro on roller skates! That was pretty neat! I've had about three opportunities
  to talk to him, but it's always been inconvenient, but I'm definitely a fan of what he does.
  
## Went back to IO

- Went to the concert. It was pretty fun!

- Update: The day after IO, I apparently had *so* much fun that I broke out in hives.
  It was *worth it* :D
