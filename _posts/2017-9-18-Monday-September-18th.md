## Daysail pics

## Thought I'd include pics from my most recent daysail.

- Sea lions!

- Coming back in. I was tasked with tying off at the bow.

- Our post meal of prosecco, caprese and tomatoes. We also had smoked oysters!

## Things to do

- Coding test (done)

- Haskell course start (done with Week 1)

- Continue with C (done with part 1..start on crypto assignment (2 and 3))

- Nanodegree videos finish (rest of week work on)

## Katas

- Format code so matches result

```
def list_animals(animals):
    list = ''
    for i in (animals):
        list += str(animals.index(i)+1) + '. ' + str(i) + '\n'
    
    return list
```

- If there is a gold in the array, return True, else False

```
def check_the_bucket(bucket):
    total = 0
    for i in bucket:
        if i == 'gold':
            total = total + 1
    if total == 0:
        return False
    else:
        return True
```

- Find unique item in a list

```
def find_uniq(arr):
# find all unique items
  a = list(set(arr))
  # find count of unique item in orig list
  for i in a:
  # if count of item is 1, that is unique item
    if arr.count(i) == 1:
      return i
```

- see if input matches type 

```
function typeValidation(variable, type) {
  if (typeof(variable) == type){
    return true
  } 
  else{
    return false
  }
}
```

- given two arrays eg [1,2,3] and [1,2]
  - 123 + 12 = 243 = [2,4,3]
  
```
function addArrays(array1, array2) {
  var arrayToNumber1 = parseInt(array1.join(''));
  var arrayToNumber = parseInt(array2.join(''));
  var arr3 = arrayToNumber1 + arrayToNumber;
  var arr4 = (arr3.toString())
  arr = arr4.split("")
  var final = []
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    final.push(parseInt(arr[(i)]))
  }
  return final
}
```

## Things of interest

- Interesting [Knuth video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4lhrVPDUG0)
  - includes McGregor graphs, Colored Queens problem, Sat Solvers
  
- Proof solution to whether 2x1 domino can cover 8x8 board

<img src="/images/domino.png" width="300">

- [Eulerian path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path) ..used in determining Tensegrity.
  Visit every path exactly once
  
- Magic Square 
  - I found this solution first, before understanding the mathematics behind it.
    My biggest question was how to figure out the total sum of each row/column/diagonal.
    Very interesting, and from Coursera's "Intro to Proofs" course.

- Another puzzle

```
"""
there is a 6 digit
number starting 100 
and is divisible by 9127
"""

total = 0
for i in range(100000,100999):
  if i % 9127 == 0:
    total = i
print total

# answer 100397
```
