## Things going on

- Finishing up my Nanodegree
- Have coding interview question to do (only 2 hours or so)

And..that's about it!

## Katas

- if you can fill an order based on stock, return true
  else return False. SKUs baby!
  
```
def fillable(stock, merch, n):
    for key in stock:
      if merch in stock:
        if key == merch and stock[key] >= n:
          return True
          break;
        elif key == merch and stock[key] < n:
          return False
      else:
        return False
        break; 
    return
```

- find the distance travelled by an elevator
  (basically floor before minus floor above in abs value).
  This was interesting; you could either zip or use list
  comprehension for this
  
```
def elevator_distance(array):
    # use list comprehension
    arr = [array[i - 1] - array[i] for i in range(1, len(array))]
    total = 0
    
    for i in arr:
      total = total + abs(i)
    return total
```

- sum array of all elements that don't have dupes

```
def repeats(arr):
    arr1 = []
    arr2 = []
    total = 0
    for i in arr:
      if arr.count(i) == 2:
        arr1.append(i)
      else:
        arr2.append(i)
    for i in arr2:
      total = total + i
    return total
```
