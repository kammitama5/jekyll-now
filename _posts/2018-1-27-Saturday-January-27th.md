## Sparklecon 5

## Hello from Sparklecon 5. 
- My yearly commute to Fullerton. My beloved poke place closed (I visited for the past two years for Taro snow and Poke), but
  otherwise, pretty much the same area. I even got some ramen to take home with me.

## What is Sparklecon?
- It's an event that is put on by 23b, a staple of the Hacker community. 

## But you're not a Hacker..or are you?
- Yes, that is true. I am *not* a hacker. However, I consider these people to be some of my very good friends, and the 
  community is part of the reason I got into programming in the first place. They're a sister organization of my 
  Hackerspace, and I try to support them when I can. 
- Also, they taught me a *lot* of the little bit I know about how computers work. Understanding file systems,
  how autentication and crypto works, which helped me to start to ask questions and to understand a bit more about 
  computers. I took my first Metasploit, crypto, PHP, Assembly workshops at my Hackerspace. I SSH-ed into my first box 
  there. I learned a bit about how raytracing works there, which got me excited about C and making things in C++. 
- These people are the real deal, and I think regardless of *how* you find your way to computing or computers, it's good
  to be around these people because they fill in *so* much knowledge. They're the real deal and a *great* community. 
- Also, my Hackerspace even taught a workshop on Emacs, which should be coming around again soon. I mean..do you know
  of *anywhere* (school, boot camp) that does that? Yeah..neither do I.
  
## So..what happens at Sparklecon?
- It's a mix of presentations but on by people in the community, and then things like robot battles, PCB-soldering, 
  drone-flying, tesla-coil demos, video-game playing and other such things that people in the general maker-scene like. 
  It's fun and I came back energized. 
  
## Here are some photos
- People have handlers, so they often don't use real names. 
- They also like their privacy. 
- They also are a good judge of whether you have an earnest interest in being a part of the community, and if so, 
  are really helpful and welcoming.
  
## Talks today
- I went to one on Electric Trains, another on Machine Learning, another on Projection mapping, another on Crypto,
  and one on Impacket (which I totally do not understand, but it helped that it was in Python).
