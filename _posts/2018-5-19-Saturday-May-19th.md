## GSoC and RustReach Day 6

## I went to sleep after 1
- Got to making a pull request in Haskell that was reviewed. I have some changes to make tonight
  and to get it all to type-check. 
- I got up around 9 and got my offer letter printed out, signed and scanned and emailed back. So that's done
  and as long as I have my IDs and all that, I get my new badge and all that. I'm really happy it's part-time
  with flexible hours, and the people seem really nice. 
- My house-sitting friend got back to me, and I can get the keys from him in the early afternoon Monday, 
  as well as my stuff over, and then get to class. I don't have to be in until Tuesday PM, so it all works.
  Wednesday is a bit tricky, but I can have it all done. 
  
## I also had a RustReach meeting!
- Had another meeting with my mentor. He's going to the Paris Rust conference! I still haven't pencilled 
  any of the Rust conferences in; my goal right now is to just keep learning and get comfortable in Haskell and Rust.
  I'm on chapter 6 of the book, and he gave me some posts to read on the ```builder pattern```, as well as some 
  general [formatting](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/fmt/index.html) and clean code tips.
  
- Also, there is a guy who is on our team who uses Rust and works for the DoD :O. Craziness! :D

## Haskell work tonight!
- Then I get up early Sunday and volunteer for two hours at a sailing booth. 
- Then I come back and do some Haskell and Rust! 
- Hopefully Monday AM I can do laundry and pack.
