## Places I've been...have we met?

## I thought I might make a list of places and groups I've passed through
- I think it can be easy to put people in a box; I have had a lot of lives.
- If you think I look familiar, we really might have met somewhere! 

## Institutions
- University of Vermont (currently, as of August 2019; I'm a researcher in training)
- Ithaca College (went to Undergraduate here; Film, Theatre, Photography and double minor in Art History and Theatre Tech. 
  I also did a Women in Leadership retreat in Seneca Falls at the National Women's Hall of Fame.)
- Cornell University (took a course called Music, Light and Dance, an interdisciplinary course, in my final semester)
- University of the West Indies Centre of Creative Arts (I studied Film and Video I and II for a year before Ithaca College)
- University of the West Indies Centre for Creative Arts (also took a summer long course on various aspects of Theatre
  Technology, including Sound Design, Lighting Design, Scenic Design, etc)
- Pasadena City College (took a bunch of architecture classes there, machining and welding and AutoCAD digital design class; at one point I thought I wanted to be an architect! I left because the machining gear was being replaced with 3D machines and I wanted to go to a school that still taught machining and had better gear)
- Glendale Community College (took a bunch of robotics, electronics/PCB classes and programming classes, which led to my
  admission into PhD candidacy...in...Computer Science?
  
## Film
- Too many films to name; probably around 200 (Los Angeles). My hair was featured in one straight to dvd one starring Tatiana
  Ali and Stacey Dash.
- I worked for one summer at the GIS in Trinidad, making documentaries for television segments. Producer was my title, but
  I did have to teach myself some Avid and Graphics and was able to interview some extraordinary people.
- I worked on a soap opera in my home country called "Westwood Park". I was an extra in two scenes; one involving a lamaze class and a club scene at a club but worked mainly as a PA and did some accounting during that time as well.
- I also worked in a camera shop and a lighting shop, prepping gear, troubleshooting and maintaining it (mostly obscure, 
 proprietary gear)
- I was a member of the SOC (Associate member) and SMPTE at one point or the other.
- I am still a member of the DSC because I think they're cool and I think they have a [cool dog](https://kammitama5.github.io/Sunday-December-17th/).
- I took a workshop on Hippotizer, learning 3D projection mapping, as well as some IATSE 728 classes.
  
## Theatre
- The Autry (LA) - Lighting Board operator for two shows
- Barnsdall Theatre (LA) - Lighting Designer for a show. Tippi Hedren starred in this show, and Melanie Griffith attended our opening show.
- Trinidad Theatre Workshop (Trinidad); I did archival work for them as they were moving into a new space.
- Central Bank Theatre (in Trinidad); I was an assistant lighting designer
- Queen's Hall (in Trinidad); think the Maljo show
- Naparima Bowl (Trinidad); did a bunch of shows as an assistant lighting designer and trained there. Also acted in some plays
  in high school there. Got a scholarship to do a theatre tech workshop there once as well (month long session).
- Arielle Tepper Summer Play Festival (New York City; 16 plays worked as a lighting tech intern). The late Heath Ledger came to one of the shows, among many celebrities. It was a strange summer.
- Film Centre Building (worked in a lighting shop in NYC for a month as an intern, and replaced fixtures for an off-broadway
  show called Forgotten on Broadway.) Apparently also home to many recording studios, so lots of musicians. Weird summer.
- Worked as a lighting tech for the Fringe Festival in NYC (same summer as the Film Centre/SPF gig). Our show had a mime!

## Art (Sculpture, Painting, Drawing, Digital, 3D Modelling, CAD, beginnings of programming...)
- I worked on putting together hundreds of fluorescent lamps over Thanksgiving break for my friend's fine art lighting installation (LA)
- Art Director's Guild (Tuesday nights live drawing). I also took part in one Art Director's Guild gallery show where three of my artworks were featured.
- Animation Guild (Jon's perspective class and many of Gnass's live drawing classes)
- Dr. Sketchy's (took part in their 72 hour long weekends of live drawing; anyone remember Turkish nights themed drawing as well?)
- Bob Kato's workshops (did those before I realized I didn't enjoy costume drawing as much)
- I was also part of the Los Feliz Drawing Club. That was pretty fun, and they had heard of the [place I am from, which is kind of rare in LA.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago)
- Concept Design Academy (took a bunch of digital painting classes there and Visual Communication and workshops)
- Red Engine School (took a bunch of digital painting classes there, eg Character Design, Environment Design, Worldbuilding)
- Foundation Arts (took a bunch of painting, charcoal and sight size drawing classes there; school is closed)
- Studio Arts (took a bunch of vfx and digital 3D classes there; I took all the Modo and Vectorworks classes, Zbrush, Maya, Digital Sketching classes and learned some Typography in Illustrator). Got first taste of scripting.
- David Simon Sculpting studio (he's awesome!)
- Gnomon (took one sculpting class there)

## Art Makerspaces
- Community Woodshop (LA);  took 2 classes there (cutting boards and bowls or something?)
- Somewhere something (took a bunch of architecture-3D-node-programming classes there) (LA)
- Matt's Molten Metalworks (LA); I took a few classes there, including one on MIG welding and mobile sculpture
- MakeSpace Arts;  I tried to go to their sculpting workshops, but I think they eventually folded :(
- Acrobotic; did quite a few fun electronics classes here including setting up a weather server, and a home detection system (in Python)
- Keystone Art Space (I think the building was bought by the Agassis and turned into a school) (LA)

- Queerious Labs (LA)
- 23B (I've been to Sparklecon a few times) (Fullerton, CA)
- Hackaday (LA, SF)
- I did a couple of Matt's PCB workshops where we made fidget spinners did PCB soldering (SF)

## Random Medical/ Study Abroad?
- I spent seven weeks of Summer in Undergrad in Bwiam, the Gambia, by route of Adelphi University, Morocco, Senegal and then
  through Banjul and Serrekunda working and living in a hospital where I worked in the pharmacy department dispensing pharmaceuticals, as well as vaccinating children in nearby villages. This was through a scholarship offered from Disney,
  in which I was one of two persons sent from my school.

## Tech
- I volunteered to help teach a class for around 10 children between 9 and 13 each weekend for a year basics of robotics (building robots and coding); the founder was an astrophysicist from Caltech who worked at Rolling Robots.(LA)
- Intern at Autodesk (remote)
- Intern at Apple (three months) (bay area)
- I was a manual tester/ sdet/ plans of making me a build/release engineer but I quit before then? for six months (LA)
- Been to many conferences, including Acadia (Computational Architecture conf at USC), Film ones (Cinegear), Academic ones (eg Neurips, AAAI, ICFP, POPL, PLDI) and Developer (Google I/O, Strange Loop, Defcon etc), or even just open houses (I've been to three JPL Open Houses) and was part of [NCAS](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2016/4/12/live-blog-ncas-spring-2016/7/) class of 2016 April cohort.
- Many, many tech meetups (WWC, LearnTeachCode, Santa Monica Haskell Group, Papers We Love, Data Science Meetups, etc)
- I've also been invited to formal recruiting events at: Twitter, Quora, Google, LinkedIn, etc

## Sailing
- I was part of a Sailing Meetup, but ditched it to join the Women Sailing Group of Santa Monica Bay. Loved that group (LA)

## What about you?
- What does your life look like? Has it been as windy?
