## Places I've been...have we met?

## I thought I might make a list of places and groups I've passed through
- I think it can be easy to put people in a box; I have had a lot of lives. If you run into me and ask "have we met",
  this might help. Often, it's difficult for me to place faces, because I've met a LOT.
- If you think I look familiar, we really might have met somewhere! See if it rings a bell. Location is a great start!
  If you can narrow it down to a field (ie what was I doing?), too, even better!
  

## From Theatre to Movies to Art to JPL to Tech to Grad school?
- Photos from a shoot I was on; not my Emmy!
- From the workshop I did at JPL as a NASA Aerospace Scholar (my mom has all my swag)

## Institutions (in order of attendance)
- University of Vermont (currently, as of August 2019; I'm a researcher in training)
- Glendale Community College (took a bunch of robotics, electronics/PCB classes and programming classes, which led to my
  admission into PhD candidacy...in...Computer Science? Uh oh what have I done?)
- Pasadena City College (took a bunch of architecture classes there, machining and welding and AutoCAD digital design class; at one point I thought I wanted to be an architect! I left because the machining gear was being replaced with 3D machines and I wanted to go to a school that still taught machining and had better gear)
- Cornell University (took a course called Music, Light and Dance, an interdisciplinary course, in my final semester)
- Ithaca College (went to Undergraduate here; Film, Theatre, Photography and double minor in Art History and Theatre Tech. 
  I also did a Women in Leadership retreat in Seneca Falls at the National Women's Hall of Fame.)
- University of the West Indies Centre of Creative Arts (I studied Film and Video I and II for a year before Ithaca College)
- University of the West Indies Centre for Creative Arts (also took a summer long course on various aspects of Theatre
  Technology, including Sound Design, Lighting Design, Scenic Design, etc)
- Attended Naparima Girls' High School (involved in a lot of choir, theatre stuff, also in Sciences class. A-levels subjects:
  Physics, Maths, Art, General Paper). I was part of my school's choir, and Prescon (we also recorded a CD in Kenny's studio). I also played drums for our school's 
  Steelpan orchestra, took traps (drums) lessons at the Normandie (with V. Maynard who played with local band Charlie's Roots), played Squash, Netball, Football (UK kind, not the American one) for a bit and was part of
  the Gymnastics and Swimteam. Also a member of the Indian Cultural Club and completed one grade of piano. Also Brownie, Junior, Senior girl guides (this might be too far back..just say Trinidad and that narrows things down a bit!)

  
## Film (Tech/Design)
- Too many films to name; probably around 200 (Los Angeles). My hair was featured in one straight to dvd one starring Tatiana
  Ali and Stacey Dash.
- I worked for one summer at the GIS in Trinidad, making documentaries for television segments. Producer was my title, but
  I did have to teach myself some Avid and Graphics and was able to interview some extraordinary people.
- I worked on a soap opera in my home country called "Westwood Park". I was an extra in two scenes; one involving a lamaze class and a club scene at a club but worked mainly as a PA and wrote cheques/ did payroll during that time as well. Near the end our crew was quite small and I got the opportunity to 2nd AC/ Slate and work with the lighting crew as well.
- I also worked in a camera shop and a lighting shop, prepping gear, troubleshooting and maintaining it (mostly obscure, 
 proprietary gear). The camera shop experience was during the 3D craze, so I learned a little bit about those types of systems. Camera electronics people are horribly underpaid compared to software people, which is unfortunate.
- I was a member of the SOC (Associate member) and SMPTE at one point or the other.
- I am still a member of the DSC because I think they're cool and I think they have a [cool dog](https://kammitama5.github.io/Sunday-December-17th/).
- I got a scholarship courtesy of Lighting Designer [Jeff Ravitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Lighting_Design_/_Lighting_Direction_for_a_Variety_Special) (multi-award Emmy nominations/ winner; mentorship kind of thing) to attend the Live Design Concert Master Lighting Class (2010). I remember because they were tearing down the New Year's Eve Ball Drop Show recording on stage when we were walking in. It was only then that I found out that they actually recorded most of the show beforehand, and only certain parts were live lol.
- I took the Basic and Advanced workshops on Hippotizer (Media Server), learning [3D projection mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_mapping), as well as some IATSE 728 classes.
- I have been to a couple premieres (my friend and I skipped Gnass's class once to attend a red carpet premiere of the film Super 8 - dvd release/party by accident...we didn't know it was a premiere lol), many screenings (including the premiere of Hugo), and every major film studio in Los Angeles (and worked on three lots).
- I also did an apprenticeship learning [Nuke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuke_(software)) at a vfx house (Nuke is a node-based compositing tool; I wanted to learn matte painting but they let me do that instead, which I'm grateful for today) for about a month for the film "Wallenda" on the Wallenda acrobats.
- I also worked on a weird movie (which ignited the software bug) in which I was assigned as the digital technician using software called Sculptor HD; the person thought I was smart enough to handle this tech that I had never seen before. I later learned that this was custom software that was being used to stretch the dynamic range of the recorded images (at a time when this was not done), even though we were using a DVX-100 (not a high quality camera). Person who invented this software also introduced me to photogrammetry and 3D motion tracking/[match-moving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_moving) software as a thank you for helping him (thus curiosity began in tech). This person also told me years ago that my punctuation indicated that I might make a great programmer, which I laughed at during that time. I am *not* a great programmer, but I am in CS, which is funny. Laugh at me.
  
## Theatre (Tech/Design)
- The Autry (LA) - Lighting Board operator for two shows
- Two Roads Theatre (LA) - Co-Designed Lighting for "Kowalski". I guess [LA times covered it](https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/07/theater-review-kowalski-at-two-roads-theatre.html) and so did [Variety](https://variety.com/2011/legit/reviews/kowalski-1117945600/).
- Barnsdall Theatre (LA) - Lighting Designer for a show. Tippi Hedren starred in this show, and Melanie Griffith attended our opening show. I believe it was featured in Playbill, but I don't keep track of such things (maybe I should have milked the press for grad school? lol)
- Trinidad Theatre Workshop (Trinidad); I did archival work for them as they were moving into a new space.
- Central Bank Theatre (in Trinidad); I was an assistant lighting designer
- Queen's Hall (in Trinidad); think the Maljo show (I was the kid who ran the light cue when the person stepped away from the board in the middle of the show lol). I also worked on the Cacique Awards as assistant lighting designer (2003) and for the 
Love Movement Show 
- Naparima Bowl (Trinidad); did a bunch of shows as an assistant lighting designer and trained there. Also acted in some plays
  in high school there. Got a scholarship to do a theatre tech workshop there once as well (month long session).
- [Arielle Tepper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arielle_Tepper) Summer Play Festival (New York City; 16 plays worked as a lighting tech intern, and follow-spot for the show Mimesophobia starring Hamish Linklater). The late Heath Ledger came to one of the shows, among many celebrities. It was a strange summer. I also interviewed with Spike Lee but didn't end up getting the gig. I also lived in the Hamptons for a month (mostly Southampton and Bridgehampton; I went to the launch of the Star Room, and a couple times to James on Main. I also attended a party at the Bridgehampton country club, where I ran into Kevin Bacon, but I was working the event, and have the most awkward K. Bacon story ever) and worked with the producers of the Lion King on Broadway. I also had my first ever Starbucks frappuccino and accidentally hit a producer in the nuts with a filing cabinet (yikes). I was their favourite intern anyways, so it paid off (I was the only one who was paid and they asked me to come back next year).
- Film Centre Building (worked in a lighting shop in NYC for a month as an intern, and replaced fixtures for an off-broadway
  show called Forgotten on Broadway.) Apparently also home to many recording studios, so lots of famous musicians coming in to work as I was leaving for the day. Weird summer.
- Worked as a lighting tech for the [Fringe Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_theatre) in NYC (same summer as the Film Centre/SPF gig). Our show had a mime and was called "Love is in the Air"
- Ithaca College; worked as a lighting tech for Fires, Dancing at Lughnasa, The Shape of Things and Violet.

## Art (Sculpture, Painting, Drawing, Digital, 3D Modelling, CAD, beginnings of programming...)
- I worked on putting together hundreds of fluorescent lamps over Thanksgiving break for my friend's fine art lighting installation (LA) for the show Light Sensitive.
- Art Director's Guild (Tuesday nights live drawing). I also took part in one Art Director's Guild gallery show where three of my artworks were featured (LA). Mimi, the head of the Guild at the time, was a great mentor to me.
- Animation Guild (Jon's perspective class and many of Gnass's live drawing classes; Gnass teaches animators at Disney and Dreamworks)(LA)
- Dr. Sketchy's (took part in their 72 hour long weekends of live drawing; anyone remember Turkish nights themed drawing as well? Put on by the artists at [Titmouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titmouse,_Inc.)) (LA)
- Bob Kato's workshops (did those before I realized I didn't enjoy costume drawing as much) (LA)
- I was also part of the Los Feliz Drawing Club. That was pretty fun, and they had heard of the [place I am from, which is kind of rare in LA.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago) (LA)
- Concept Design Academy (took a bunch of digital painting classes there and Visual Communication and workshops, which involved a trip to the Tank Museum). [Robh Ruppel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robh_Ruppel)'s workshop left a huge impression on me (LA)
- Red Engine School (took a bunch of digital painting classes there, eg Character Design, Environment Design, Worldbuilding). [Patrick Hanenberger](http://www.patrickhanenberger.com/about)'s Worldbuilding workshop left a huge impression on me (LA)

- Studio Arts (took a bunch of vfx and digital 3D classes there; I took all the Modo and Vectorworks classes, Zbrush, Maya, Digital Sketching classes and learned some Typography in Illustrator. I also learned Rhino, which is still my go-to software for mock-ups. Learned about [Renderman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar_RenderMan)). Got first taste of scripting in Rhino+Modo class. I also took a couple classes by the amazing [Jordu Schell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordu_Schell). (LA)
- David Simon Sculpting studio (he's awesome and runs a workshop once a year in Rome. A lot of art+tech people enjoy his classes! He gave me one of the best pieces of advice, ever, which is that as long as you invest in yourself, you will be okay. I still follow this advice!) (LA)
- I also took a couple workshops with Spiderzero, who works for [Del Toro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_del_Toro). He was also originally a web programmer. His life advice left a huge impression on me; very wise guy.
- Gnomon (took one sculpting class there) (LA)
- I also attended a Duralene workshop at Carter Sexton in Noho (LA). Duralene is this awesome material that you can layer texture onto. I may have also taken a super sculpey class there (I forget).

## Art Makerspaces (Maker/hacker scene)
- Community Woodshop (LA);  took 2 classes there (cutting boards and bowls or something?) (LA)
- Somewhere something (took a bunch of architecture-3D-node-programming classes there). Learned about generative art and started programming interest here (LA)
- Matt's Molten Metalworks (LA); I took a few classes there, including one on MIG welding and mobile sculpture inspired by MIT's sculptures (person who ran shop was a MechE from MIT) (LA)
- MakeSpace Arts;  I tried to go to their sculpting workshops, but I think they eventually folded :( (LA)
- Acrobotic; did quite a few fun electronics classes here including setting up a weather server, and a home detection system (in Python) (LA)

## Random Medical/ Doctors Without Borders Study Abroad? (Science?)
- I spent seven weeks of Summer in Undergrad in Bwiam, the Gambia, by route of Adelphi University, Morocco, Senegal and then
  through Banjul and Serrekunda working and living in a hospital (Sulayman Junkung Hospital) where I worked in the pharmacy department dispensing pharmaceuticals, as well as vaccinating children and taking blood pressure (BP) in nearby villages. The mural we painted as a group was the last known mural at the particular hospital. This was through a scholarship offered from Disney, in which I was one of two persons sent from my school. (West Africa)
  
## Maths 
- MSRI (Derived Algebraic Geometry workshop for women) (bay area)
- Simons Institute (Error-correcting codes workshop) (bay area)
- Cornell Number Theory Conference 2019 (NY)

I've also been to a few Von Karman lectures and to the JPL German Club several times. (LA)
- Many, many tech meetups (WWC, LearnTeachCode, Santa Monica Haskell Group, Papers We Love, Data Science Meetups, etc). This how I found functional programming, and research papers, and started whetting my appetite for what I would enjoy in tech. (various)
- I've also been invited to formal recruiting events at: Twitter, Quora, Google, LinkedIn, Netflix, etc (various)

## Sailing
- I was part of a Sailing Meetup, but ditched it to join the Women Sailing Group of Santa Monica Bay. Loved that group. Maybe we sailed to Catalina Island or to Newport beach together? (CA)
