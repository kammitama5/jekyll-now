## Places I've been...have we met?

## I thought I might make a list of places and groups I've passed through
- I think it can be easy to put people in a box; I have had a lot of lives. If you run into me and ask "have we met",
  this might help. Often, it's difficult for me to place faces, because I've met a LOT.
- If you think I look familiar, we really might have met somewhere! See if it rings a bell. Location is a great start!
  If you can narrow it down to a field (ie what was I doing?), too, even better!

## Institutions (in order of attendance)
- University of Vermont (currently, as of August 2019; I'm a researcher in training)
- Glendale Community College (took a bunch of robotics, electronics/PCB classes and programming classes, which led to my
  admission into PhD candidacy...in...Computer Science? Uh oh what have I done?)
- Pasadena City College (took a bunch of architecture classes there, machining and welding and AutoCAD digital design class; at one point I thought I wanted to be an architect! I left because the machining gear was being replaced with 3D machines and I wanted to go to a school that still taught machining and had better gear)
- Cornell University (took a course called Music, Light and Dance, an interdisciplinary course, in my final semester)
- Ithaca College (went to Undergraduate here; Film, Theatre, Photography and double minor in Art History and Theatre Tech. 
  I also did a Women in Leadership retreat in Seneca Falls at the National Women's Hall of Fame.)
- University of the West Indies Centre of Creative Arts (I studied Film and Video I and II for a year before Ithaca College)
- University of the West Indies Centre for Creative Arts (also took a summer long course on various aspects of Theatre
  Technology, including Sound Design, Lighting Design, Scenic Design, etc)
- Attended Naparima Girls' High School (involved in a lot of choir, theatre stuff, also in Sciences class. A-levels subjects:
  Physics, Maths, Art, General Paper). I was part of my school's choir, and Prescon (we also recorded a CD in Kenny's studio). I also played drums for our school's 
  Steelpan orchestra, took traps (drums) lessons at the Normandie, played Squash, Netball, Football for a bit and was part of
  the Gymnastics and Swimteam. Also a member of the Indian Cultural Club and completed one grade of piano. Also Brownie, Junior, Senior girl guides (this might be too far back..just say Trinidad and that narrows things down a bit!)

  
## Film (Tech/Design)
- Too many films to name; probably around 200 (Los Angeles). My hair was featured in one straight to dvd one starring Tatiana
  Ali and Stacey Dash.
- I worked for one summer at the GIS in Trinidad, making documentaries for television segments. Producer was my title, but
  I did have to teach myself some Avid and Graphics and was able to interview some extraordinary people.
- I worked on a soap opera in my home country called "Westwood Park". I was an extra in two scenes; one involving a lamaze class and a club scene at a club but worked mainly as a PA and wrote cheques/ did payroll during that time as well. Near the end our crew was quite small and I got the opportunity to 2nd AC/ Slate and work with the lighting crew as well.
- I also worked in a camera shop and a lighting shop, prepping gear, troubleshooting and maintaining it (mostly obscure, 
 proprietary gear)
- I was a member of the SOC (Associate member) and SMPTE at one point or the other.
- I am still a member of the DSC because I think they're cool and I think they have a [cool dog](https://kammitama5.github.io/Sunday-December-17th/).
- I took a workshop on Hippotizer, learning 3D projection mapping, as well as some IATSE 728 classes.
- I have been to a couple premieres (my friend and I skipped Gnass's class once to attend a red carpet premiere of the film 8mm by accident...we didn't know it was a premiere lol), many screenings (including the premiere of Hugo), and every major film studio in Los Angeles (and worked on three lots).
- I also did an apprenticeship learning Nuke at a vfx house (Nuke is a node-based compositing tool) for about a month for the film "Wallenda" on the Wallenda acrobats.
  
## Theatre (Tech/Design)
- The Autry (LA) - Lighting Board operator for two shows
- Barnsdall Theatre (LA) - Lighting Designer for a show. Tippi Hedren starred in this show, and Melanie Griffith attended our opening show.
- Trinidad Theatre Workshop (Trinidad); I did archival work for them as they were moving into a new space.
- Central Bank Theatre (in Trinidad); I was an assistant lighting designer
- Queen's Hall (in Trinidad); think the Maljo show (I was the kid who ran the light cue when the person stepped away from the board in the middle of the show lol)
- Naparima Bowl (Trinidad); did a bunch of shows as an assistant lighting designer and trained there. Also acted in some plays
  in high school there. Got a scholarship to do a theatre tech workshop there once as well (month long session).
- Arielle Tepper Summer Play Festival (New York City; 16 plays worked as a lighting tech intern). The late Heath Ledger came to one of the shows, among many celebrities. It was a strange summer. I also interviewed with Spike Lee but didn't end up getting the gig. I also lived in the Hamptons for a month (mostly Southampton and Bridgehampton) and worked with the producers of the Lion King on Broadway. I also had my first ever Starbucks frappuccino and accidentally hit a producer in the nuts with a filing cabinet (yikes). I was their favourite intern anyways, so it paid off.
- Film Centre Building (worked in a lighting shop in NYC for a month as an intern, and replaced fixtures for an off-broadway
  show called Forgotten on Broadway.) Apparently also home to many recording studios, so lots of musicians. Weird summer.
- Worked as a lighting tech for the Fringe Festival in NYC (same summer as the Film Centre/SPF gig). Our show had a mime!

## Art (Sculpture, Painting, Drawing, Digital, 3D Modelling, CAD, beginnings of programming...)
- I worked on putting together hundreds of fluorescent lamps over Thanksgiving break for my friend's fine art lighting installation (LA)

## Random Medical/ Doctors Without Borders Study Abroad? (Science?)
- I spent seven weeks of Summer in Undergrad in Bwiam, the Gambia, by route of Adelphi University, Morocco, Senegal and then
  through Banjul and Serrekunda working and living in a hospital where I worked in the pharmacy department dispensing pharmaceuticals, as well as vaccinating children and taking blood pressure (BP) in nearby villages. The mural we painted as a group was the last known mural at the particular hospital. This was through a scholarship offered from Disney, in which I was one of two persons sent from my school. (West Africa)

I've also been to a few Von Karman lectures and to the JPL German Club several times. (LA)
- Many, many tech meetups (WWC, LearnTeachCode, Santa Monica Haskell Group, Papers We Love, Data Science Meetups, etc). This how I found functional programming, and research papers, and started whetting my appetite for what I would enjoy in tech. (various)
- I've also been invited to formal recruiting events at: Twitter, Quora, Google, LinkedIn, etc (various)

## Sailing
- I was part of a Sailing Meetup, but ditched it to join the Women Sailing Group of Santa Monica Bay. Loved that group. Maybe we sailed to Catalina Island or to Newport beach together? (CA)

## What about you?
- What does your life look like? Has it been as windy?
