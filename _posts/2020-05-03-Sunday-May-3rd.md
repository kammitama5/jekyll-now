## Places I've been...have we met?

## I thought I might make a list of places and groups I've passed through
- I think it can be easy to put people in a box; I have had a lot of lives.
- If you think I look familiar, we really might have met somewhere! 

## Institutions
- Univesity of Vermont (currently, as of August 2019; I'm a researcher in training)
- Ithaca College (went to Undergraduate here; Film, Theatre, Photography and double minor in Art History and Theatre Tech)
- Cornell University (took a course called Music, Light and Dance here in my final semester)
- University of the West Indies Centre of Creative Arts (I studied Film and Video I and II for a year before Ithaca College)
- University of the West Indies Centre for Creative Arts (also took a summer long course on various aspects of Theatre
  Technology, including Sound Design, Lighting Design, Scenic Design, etc)
- Pasadena City College (took a bunch of architecture classes there, machining and welding and AutoCAD digital design class; at one point I thought I wanted to be an architect! I left because the machining gear was being replaced with 3D machines and I wanted to go to a school that still taught machining and had better gear)
- Glendale Community College (took a bunch of robotics, electronics/PCB classes and programming classes, which led to my
  admission into PhD candidacy
  
## Film
- Too many films to name; probably around 200 (Los Angeles). My hair was featured in one straight to dvd one starring Tatiana
  Ali and Stacey Dash.
- I worked for one summer at the GIS in Trinidad, making documentaries for television segments. Producer was my title, but
  I did have to teach myself some Avid and Graphics and was able to interview some extraordinary people.
- I worked on a soap opera in my home country called "Westwood Park". I was an extra in two scenes; one involving a lamaze class and a club scene at a club but worked mainly as a PA and did some accounting during that time as well.
- I also worked in a camera shop and a lighting shop, prepping gear, troubleshooting and maintaining it (mostly obscure, 
 proprietary gear)
- I was a member of the SOC (Associate member) and SMPTE at one point or the other.
- I am still a member of the DSC because I think they're cool and I think they have a [cool dog](https://kammitama5.github.io/Sunday-December-17th/).
- I took a workshop on Hippotizer, learning 3D projection mapping, as well as some IATSE 728 classes.
