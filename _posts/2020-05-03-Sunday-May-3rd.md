## Places I've been...have we met?

## I thought I might make a list of places and groups I've passed through
- I think it can be easy to put people in a box; I have had a lot of lives.
- If you think I look familiar, we really might have met somewhere! 

## Institutions
- Ithaca College (went to Undergraduate here; Film, Theatre, Photography and double minor in Art History and Theatre Tech)
- Cornell University (took a course called Music, Light and Dance here in my final semester)

- University of the West Indies Centre for Creative Arts (also took a summer long course on various aspects of Theatre
  Technology, including Sound Design, Lighting Design, Scenic Design, etc)
- Pasadena City College (took a bunch of architecture classes there, machining and welding; at one point I thought I wanted to be an architect!)
- Glendale Community College (took a bunch of robotics, electronics/PCB classes and programming classes, which led to my
  admission into PhD candidacy
  
## Film
- Too many films to name; probably around 200 (Los Angeles). My hair was featured in one straight to dvd one starring Tatiana
  Ali and Stacey Dash.
- I worked on a soap opera in my home country called "Westwood Park". I was an extra in two scenes; one involving a lamaze class and a club scene at a club

 proprietary gear)
