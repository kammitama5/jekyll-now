## GSoc and RustReach Day 29, and a Bit of Progress...

## I can die happily right now
- After a meeting with my mentor, Chris, and his suggestions, I was able to make a function in Haskell
  to print cleanly to the UI. Gabe is flying back from Zurich today, so he gets to spend time with his family.
  I feel kind of badly taking time away from people, but they've both reminded me that they committed to spend this
  time with me this summer. Anyways...I went...

## You have no idea
- How happy this makes me. I have to go through with the other constructors,
  get confirmation that I'm in the right direction and write some tests.
- I also had some build errors initially because a mutual friend and contributor, Richard, installed some AWS stuff.
  So I had to install some stuff on my end to get it to build and run, which was not a huge problem. I'm learning how
  to resolve some errors.
- I just want to carry my laptop with me everywhere and work on Haskell every chance I get. Things are really making
  more sense, even though I feel like a Haskell-ignoramus compared to everyone else.

## I also did first eval
- It's the first checkpoint, so I had to do an evaluation of my mentors. 
  It was pretty much a formality and wasn't very detailed or anything,
  and they explained that as long as I don't bail or give up or anything,
  I should expect to pass.
- I'm pretty much really happy for the opportunity to work in (and get paid)
  doing Haskell this summer, get a foot in the door to work on real code,
  and have *great* mentors. So I can't complain. I trust them completely.
- I have more hesitation in my own abilities, but strangely, they seem to know
  how to get work out of me for things I wouldn't imagine being able to solve on
  my own. So that's good, and I guess, is the whole point.


## I sat an exam today, also
- So I had to leave early from work, which was kind of meh. However, I was writing
  tests at work; Ad-hoc testing. I found it to be a lot like writing documentation 
  (or at least approached it that way), so yours truly was making diagrams, taking
  snapshots and stuff. Of course, when I submit it I'm probably going to have to do
  a bunch of stuff over, but right now, I'm enjoying it because I like being nit-picky
  about how things are laid out in the application. It feels like writing documentation
  for a library or something on github.
  
## I also had the worst diet of all time today
- I swear; my meals today were a frappacinno, a pack of Cheddar Chex Mix and an order of fries today.
  That was it, pretty much, besides straight up tea all day. I've *never* eaten so badly in my life
  before. Pretty embarrassed. Never again.
  
## Anyways
- So far, so good. Going to keep at it on the Haskell-train. I'm excited for the Haskell Book club, also.
  Should be fun!
- Also, I have a race on Friday. I just got an email reminding me. I think it's a good idea to race occasionally
  because it keeps my energy up and it keeps me competitive, which is good discipline for becoming good at anything.
  It's good to do a sport!
  
## That's it!
