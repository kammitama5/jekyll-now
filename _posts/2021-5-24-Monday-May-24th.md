## RLOS Week 2!

## I'm back!
- And guess what!? I got the config script to run from my local env remotely!
- My next step is to do this with data, and test out some other config scripts. I can't wait!!!
- I had some login issues because the account was under one of my mentors' emails (ie a Msft email), but, in the most *amazing* move, my mentor was up at uh..11pm? and 
added my email to the account, so I could log-in and respond to authentication verification. Talk about going above and beyond! So impressive!
- He was also super aware that I should head to sleep soon, though, and we could talk during our meeting tomorrow, after we celebrated that things worked!! Super cool!!!

## So on to my next task!
- I'm super excited and will update as the week progresses, in this space.
- It's almost tomorrow, so uh, I should get some sleep.

## Other stuff happening this week
- There is a LOT going on. I'm at [IEEE S&P](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2021/), and met the most *amazing* mentor. We had a speed-mentorship, and I thought I would meet people briefly, but
I ended up having one of the most *thoughtful* conversations about how to navigate research, Academia, and the general PhD by one of the Session Chairs.
What was amazing was that he followed up by saying "I have an article for you". I have to thank him immensely, but I have been combing through the references
of the article he sent; they're all so good!
- Here is the [article](https://medium.com/digital-diplomacy/how-to-look-for-ideas-in-computer-science-research-7a3fa6f4696f) he sent here! I also 
shared it with persons in my lab (as we focus on Security and Privacy, too). But regardless of the field, it's such an in-depth, thorough, amazing article!
Thank you so much for sharing this with me! This session was so unexpected! I went back into IEEE S&P feeling like I belonged. I enjoy the conference in general.
- I have RLOS mentor meetings, a meeting with my advisor, a [WISP Privacy+Law Forum](https://www.privacysecurityacademy.com/) conference, an R workshop, my workshop at the Alan Turing Institute, my blockchain 
fellowship, my NCWIT meetings, my FAIR mentorship meeting with podmates, and a meeting with the recent ICLR 2021 DEI chairs and my co-chair! We have some exciting
things planned for 2022, and I hope it creates a positive impact! I'd like these opportunities and access to be better than they were for me when I was trying to 
figure out whether I wanted to do grad school, and navigating how to do research at all. That kind of access could change someone's life trajectory, and this
particular kind of position isn't about me; it's about giving back and engaging with the community, which is awesome.

## Oh! I got my laptop!
- Internship laptop showed up in the mail and it's *gasp* a Thinkpad!!!!!!! YESSSSSSS!!!
- I can see my sysadmin friend from night school smile from California. He *loves* Thinkpads, and used to have a giant Kirby on his. 
- Those times, though stressful, were a lot of fun because the people in this class were quite a bunch! You'd look around and see people in Java class
playing chess in class, or buying ammo online (LOL). In one class, I remember that half the class was playing [Agar.io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar.io).
Looking back, it was so valuable to be exposed to that perspective; I was there long enough to get a sense of what it takes for those students to transfer (it's 
really hard!), to gain opportunities and be taken seriously (you're in limbo as a night school student because even though you're obtaining undergrad credits,
you don't technically qualify for undergrad opportunities, which sucks!), and how they have a bit of an individualistic streak because they also have life experience.
They're not the type of students who followed the straight path, so you meet some really interesting people, and they teach you things about how the system is
set up to help them fail or succeed.

## Anyways
- I should go to sleep; it's tomorrow already! I will add as things progress this week! But this is exciting and awesome and I love this all so much!!!

## And that's it
