## GSoC and RustReach Day 35

## This will be short

- Firstly "HAPPY FATHER'S DAY!!!". Called mine and had a chat. I could talk to him for hours, or pretty
  much anyone from my family. I love 'em! They keep me grounded and they always make me laugh.
- I'm packed. I'm charging my phone and have my clothes set out, but I'm pretty much all good for my trip
  tomorrow, and checked-in. I'm really excited; the group of us looks good, and I'll have a roommate.
- I have a window seat to and back (phew). I won't have my Shake Shack (wrong airline..that's in July!),
  but I think this is the terminal with Dunkin', so...haha. LAX is such a hot mess! Carry a good sense
  of humour with you because it's a train wreck...very disorganized.
- I'll take a cup of attitude to go, please :D
- I think I'm going to go to work in the morning for a few hours, because it's one bus stop away from
  work, so it will be cheaper if I go in the morning and take the bus to the airport. 
- It's going to be a six hour flight. Yikes. I thought it was five! I'm probably going to get internet
  and work on Haskell, to be honest. Makes no sense just doing nothing for six hours. I think I get in
  around 9:52pm or something. And my workshop (PLMW) starts the very next morning. The calibre of people
  affiliated with the conference is pretty amazing. I guess it's also on the East Coast, but the list of my
  peers is pretty much Ivies...I saw Yale, MIT, UPenn, CMU, Princeton email addresses. I'm honoured but there
  is also so much I can learn from them. The dream would be to work in either Haskell or Racket for 5 years.
  Hmm..five years of Haskell would be amazing. I don't think I'd speak English anymore..just Haskell. :D
  And I'd spend every summer working at a company that uses Haskell,
  or a lab or something. That or Rust would be fine. I'm enjoying Rust. 
  But life-goals...Haskell, Rust, Racket. I guess that may make me unemployable to a lot of companies...uhhh. Ok.
  
## I've been working on Rust
- Today was a day of working on Rust. I think if I close my eyes right now, I can see compiler errors and warnings.

## Other than that
- Pretty good. I'm excited to get back into Haskell tomorrow. I also need to start digging into finding some
  more open source sites and updating HOSS. But that's lower down in terms of priorities.

## Today is pretty chill
- So that's about it for me. I got a lot of commits done yesterday, but there is still some clean-up before it's
  merged to master.
