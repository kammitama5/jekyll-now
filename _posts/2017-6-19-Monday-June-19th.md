## NanoDegree Cont'd and Robot workshop 

- Moving along today 
- I started on some basic CSS

We learned about Boxify-ing an image. 
- This is how I broke mine down.
  So I got 14 elements.

## Really helpful! 

- I love how succinct but also helpful it is!

- I also posted the review here so that later on, I don't have to go back to the forum,
  (which has a degree of clutter from old posts),
  but can just look at my blog and make necessary adjustments.
  
- The one I posted is on a CodePen [here](https://codepen.io/kammitama5/pen/NgpMMN).

- I like the tool this mentor suggested : [Validitator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/html-validator/cgndfbhngibokieehnjhbjkkhbfmhojo/related?hl=en)

## I am going to a robotics workshop. 

- simple Robot, but hopefully I get to post some pics!
- I found a cable for my Linux laptop, so we'll see how
  that goes.
  
## Tomorrow...On a Journey

- So I finish my workshop tonight, and then am taking a bus
  early morning to San Francisco. So yeah...

## And..look who came back :)
