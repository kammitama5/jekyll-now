## GSoC Day 49

## Back from a Break

- So I'm back from a break of blogging. 
- I did a bit of Elm (it was at work so I didn't take any photos).
- I did a bit of Rust clap work

- This was actually fun! I made some command-line flags and options.

## I also have text on the slider!
- Hells yeah! Who woulda thunk it?
