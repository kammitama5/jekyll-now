## Buzz moves!

## Hi Everyone! 

- I've been busy working on my game.
  Good news! He moves and is animated! 
  I actually set him to the bottom left so I can work on jumping, gravity and collision.
  So those are my next goals.

## Also

- I'm on the waitlist for Discrete Structures! 
  I'm number 17...yayyyy :)
  
- I think regardless, I'll take this class, just because it's in C++.

## I also stayed up late

- I was up late last night looking at Sandy make a game in Haskell!
