## Simple 2D Rendering

## The Day Before LambdaConf

- Man, everyone is excited. You can *feel* the excitement on Twitter.
  We're a rowdy, eclectic bunch...functional programmers. 
  We're all excited to meet up with friends who are like family.
  
- You can tell, because people are being a bit more productive in the days
  leading up to LambdaConf. Pretty funny. A lot of contributions to Github
  in Racket, Haskell, PureScript, and Immutable JS :)
  
## I've never been to Boulder before

- There is excitement because I'm going to a new place.
  Also, I have class the night before, so I go home, do laundry,
  pack and then head to the airport tomorrow. 
  
## I may miss PureScript conf

- But we have a pretty good PureScript group where I'm located.
  So I'm not too worried, even though it would have been nice to learn a bit.
  
## I got through learning to make a simple 2D Renderer today

## Also -> Compilers

- My [Dragon book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools) showed up in the mail last night. 
  So I spent until midnight reading about Compilers and how they're made.
  My dream would be to build one in C++. That would probably take me a lifetime. 
  
## Got into

- Officially doing Advanced C++ for Fall. It's the class I should have taken before
  taking the class I'm taking now, but it's okay. My goal is just to do as much C++
  as possible. 
 
 - I may want to do Assembly after that (we have about three courses), 
   but it may be the same semester as the one in which I'd like to do an internship at JPL.
   So we'll see. 
   
## Things to get done 

- I have homework to do 
- Also have to contribute to the board online 

- I may be late on this one, but I'd prefer to understand it fully rather than just do it 
  just because. 
  
- I also plan to spend time in the break in-between just writing a lot of C++.
