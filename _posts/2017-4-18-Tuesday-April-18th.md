## 4/18/17 - A Bit of Rest


## Today I learned

- In C++, you can exit a programme gracefully by typing "return(0)".
  Since you have int main() and it's looking for a return int, you can insert it anywhere
  to exit. Sort of like system.exit or whatever in other programmes.
  
  
## C++ homework done.

A few snippets of code. I didn't include another three linked .h files here. Don't want people to copy, etc.

Also, what my debugger looks like when the programme is run.

## Things to get done 

- Look over some code for C++ and submit (hopefully) to my Lab ---> done

- Do some more work on my Programming for Correctness work. I'm currently on Split ranges

- Get some rest tonight, and be fresh to work on Homework 6 (due 4/23)


## A Kata Solved (note: this is in Python) :)

```
# In this Kata, you have to find the factors of integer 
# down to the limit including the limiting number.
# If the limit is more than the integer, return an empty list

def factors(integer, limit):
      # make an empty list
      arr = [] 
      
      # if limit exceeds integer, return an empty array 
      if limit > integer:
        return []
        
        # else, find all the factors of the integer 
        # between the limit and the integer
        # push those factors to the empty array
      else:
        for i in range(limit, integer+1):
          if integer % i == 0:
            arr.append(i)
        return arr

```

## And now, another puzzle 

How many balls would you need to assemble a regular tetrahedron,
if the edge of the tetrahedron consist of x balls? 

Write a function that takes the value and returns the count of balls needed.

The solution is an interesting one, based on a formula called "The Tetrahedral number"

also, check out another favourite site of mine, Math Stack Exchange:

[Math Stack Exchange Tetrahedral number](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1148720/finding-the-formula-for-the-number-of-golf-balls-in-a-triangular-pyramid-with-n)



As for the solution, this is in Python, too (sorry) :)

```
def count_balls(x):
    // the formula is :
    return n * ((x + 1) * (x + 2)) / 6

```

## Side note

I figured out how to re-write fractions and limits in LaTeX. Here is my code for generating the Tetrahedral formula
