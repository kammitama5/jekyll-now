## GSoC and RustReach Day 34

## It's Saturday

- I hurt *all over*, but I feel oddly *really* refreshed! Sailing (especially racing) is good for me!
- I completed my meeting with Aaron for RustReach, and we spent an hour talking about compilers and a really
  neat project called [Tokei](https://github.com/Aaronepower/tokei) that he made. I have to say, he's a great match
  as a mentor. So I have all super-awesome mentors this summer! :D
