## Data Continued...

## This is really quite fun!

- I'm *really* enjoying the Data Science work. It's challenging, rewarding, but it also makes sense.

- Today, I analyzed some wine data

## We started out with two csv files

- They were initially separated by semi-colons, so had to fix that! 

- There were two separate data files with similar columns; red and white.
  We were tasked with creating a column called "color" that would also give the color,
  and then we were to merge these two data-sets together, which makes sense.

- Observed the data, created a white and red column for each dataset and merged to two in a new edited file
  containing both datasets
  
- I verified that both datasets were, in fact, appended by  looking at the head and tail of the dataset

## I made a mistake!

- On the first try, I accidentally set the header to false, so the edited file had no Header for the Columns. Yikes!

- Fixed it! That meant updating the edited file! 
  I also had to rename a column before I could combine it into the one file. 
  I was silly and didn't discover that it had created a NaN column of values from the old
  one, so I had to delete that column, which brought me back to the 13 columns of data, 
  properly named.

- So far, so good!

## Visualizations

- Learned how to do some simple diagrams / visualization using Seaborn

## Common Functions
- This is using a different data-set that is associated with EPA data and carbon emissions. 

- Checking for non-null values

- Checking for dupes

## What I like so far

- The cells in Jupyter are great in that they allow you to focus on single, specified tasks rather
  than looking at pages of an intimidating code-base. 
  
- It also is quite functional; you're chaining functions together ```(eg. .sum().mean()).```
  Haven't written a single ```self.ihatemylife``` yet :D
  
## To do

- Finish up chapter, which includes a *lot* of SQL and more Case Studies
- Finish up project 1, project 2
- Finish up Data Analysis coursework from other shorter course (project 3 and 4)
- Finish up application
- Prepare for interviews (I have two on 1/1)! *bites nails*

## Katas

- find consecutive pairs (tuples) given a list :
  eg ```[1,2,3,4,5] == [(1,2), (3,4), 5]; count = 2 ```
  (Python)
  
```
def pairs(ar):
  arr = zip(ar[0::2], ar[1::2])
  count = 0
  for i in arr:
    if abs(i[0] - i[1]) == 1:
      count = count + 1
  return count
```

- if number is multiple of index, return (JavaScript)

```
function multipleOfIndex(array) {
  var arr = []
  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
  {
    if (array[i] % i == 0)
    {
      arr.push(array[i])
    }
  }
  return arr;
}
```

## And, that's about it
