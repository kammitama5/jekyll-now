## Data Continued...

## This is really quite fun!

- I'm *really* enjoying the Data Science work. It's challenging, rewarding, but it also makes sense.

- Today, I analyzed some wine data

## We started out with two csv files

- They were initially separated by semi-colons, so had to fix that!

- Observed the data, created a white and red column for each dataset and merged to two in a new edited file
  containing both datasets
  
- I verified that both datasets were, in fact, appended by  looking at the head and tail of the dataset

## I made a mistake!

- On the first try, I accidentally set the header to false, so the edited file had no Header for the Columns. Yikes!

- Fixed it! That meant updating the edited file! 
  I also had to rename a column before I could combine it into the one file. 
  I was silly and didn't discover that it had created a NaN column of values from the old
  one, so I had to delete that column, which brought me back to the 13 columns of data, 
  properly named.

- So far, so good!

## Visualizations

- Learned how to do some simple diagrams / visualization using Seaborn

## Common Functions
- This is using a different data-set that is associated with EPA data and carbon emissions. 

- Checking for non-null values
