## HP and the Machine

## Hello...from Palo Alto!

- Okay, sort of a lie.
  I went to Mountain View first, and got a mango slush from [Teaspoon!](http://www.teaspoonfun.com/)

## Hung out a bit...

- I went up to a Starbucks in Palo Alto and randomly met a CS professor
  from Stanford who is now retired, who is originally from the UK (British),
  named Caleb. He was quite kind, and after we met and shook hands, and I told
  him why I was in the area, he smiled and said to take care of myself, 
  and continued working, tapping away on his laptop, as I worked on mine.

## Then I went to HP, for a talk on their memory driven-computer, "The Machine".

## Advantages of Memory Driven Computing

- Fast, persistent memory
- Their system uses a photonic engine that eliminates distance as a hindrance 
  (as opposed to using copper, where energy
  is dependent on distance) and creates otherwise impossible topologies
- it's task specific processing

## Using Photonics

- This copper stack is replaced by this photonic cable (the thin one above it)

## The photonic engine (with scaled-up version)

## Data Structures..how do we program such a system

- We use pointers because we can directly access memory. 
  There is no need for serializing and deserializing data. 
  For example, in Java, no usage of "new".
  
## Example using Managed (garbage collection) vs unmanaged (C++).

- Uses data structure called MPGC (GC is garbage collection)

## Java without serializing and deserializing data

- Susan Spence mentioned that to share the data, you'd then give it a name
  and it would be available to other applications, because they share memory.

## The idea of containers booting up within a nanosecond

- She spoke about have a system in which shifting from one container to another
  is a process swap, so would take a nano-second instead of a minute.
  Perhaps renting a system to someone who needs that sort of access to that storage
  for say, only an hour. 
  
- There would be no disk communication latency because you would be working directly
  with the memory. That makes sense for numerical computation. 
  
## Data structures using Graph Theory

- One of the concepts she spoke about very much reminded me of diffs or deltas in 
  Github. So I chatted with her afterwards and she said they were very much looking
  into graph theory. I asked her why she thought there is a lot of a concentration in 
  general in that area for solving computational problems, and she was saying because
  of the sort of complexities you get because of the intersection of attributes. 
  
- She spoke about using LSGI and other such algorithms. Also, SPARKLE, which uses
  a bit of Scala and Akka.

## Questions

- If everything is in one memory centre, with such a large data size,
  what sort of time and what sort of checks will be used for vulnerabilities/
  someone hacking into your system?
  
- I hadn't heard of neuromorphic computing before. Would like to find out more about that.

- Want to know more about Fabric Attached Memory
  
## Overall, a wonderful night!

- A little bit of hype, but some incredibly smart people.
  I'm happy I attended, and I even saw Ken, my Xoogler friend! 
  I also met some really nice robotics people.
