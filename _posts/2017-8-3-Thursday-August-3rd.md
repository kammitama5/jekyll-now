## HP and the Machine

## Hello...from Palo Alto!

- Okay, sort of a lie.
  I went to Mountain View first, and got a mango slush from [Teaspoon!](http://www.teaspoonfun.com/)

## Hung out a bit...

- I went up to a Starbucks in Palo Alto and randomly met a CS professor
  from Stanford who is now retired, who is originally from the UK (British),
  named Caleb. He was quite kind, and after we met and shook hands, and I told
  him why I was in the area, he smiled and said to take care of myself, 
  and continued working, tapping away on his laptop, as I worked on mine.

## Then I went to HP, for a talk on their memory driven-computer, "The Machine".



## Questions

- If everything is in one memory centre, with such a large data size,
  what sort of time and what sort of checks will be used for vulnerabilities/
  someone hacking into your system?
  
## Overall, a wonderful night!
