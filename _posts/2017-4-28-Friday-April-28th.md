## More on this...
- [Functions and epimorphisms by Bartosz Milewski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lZkr-aAqk)

- [Math Exchange -> What is isomorphism](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/441758/what-does-isomorphic-mean-in-linear-algebra)

- Interestingly, "guards" in Haskell have the same context in predicate calculus. I learned that today.
  (Learn more about "guards" in Haskell via the Haskell wiki [here](https://wiki.haskell.org/Pattern_guard)

PS I'm learning a lot of this myself, so if you find any errata, 
please feel free to email me on the [about page](https://kammitama5.github.io/about/)

## Things to get done:

- Meeting with Liz (6:45pm) -> went well; we made a simple
  App Guessing-Game so I could learn a bit more about the DOM in JS.

- Logic work cont'd

- C++ quiz (probably will be done Saturday evening)

- C++ lab start (design game structure, templates needed, etc) -> starting Sunday.
