## 5/8/17 - Learnin'

## TIL

I sort of didn't have an idea of exactly *what* a game engine was,
even though I appparently made one in Java before (whoops).

## So...

- To strengthen my understanding of C++, 
  started on this Game Engine one for C++.
  
- This is this tutorial by the [Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw). 
  He's pretty awesome.
  
- One of things I think I defintely have ahead of people in class is just pure mileage.
  A lot of people don't even have a Github, or if they do, it's pretty empty, or only filled
  with class homework. :(
  
- I don't get that at all...I think programming's fun, so it's always worthwhile 
  to learn something or build as many things as you can.
  
- I want to especially get better at:
  C++
  Haskell 
  
- I think that those two will do something special for my ability if I keep learning them,
  in addition to whatever other stuff I *have* to learn (*cough JavaScript, Python, etc*)
  
Anyways, there are neat tricks like:
  
- hold alt and you can drag and select a group of objects

## To start, we loaded Two main libraries:
  
 - [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/)
 
 - [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
 
## That took a while...

- You had to link them to your folders after unzipping them.
  Interestingly, *not* as painful as Java SDKs for me. 
  
I was surprised it all worked!

## Rendering 

Then we got some Colour in there

## ...and Rendering

Then we got a triangle rendered vertex by vertex

And checked the resolution of our screen

And then made sure our imaged scaled with the resized screen

And tested stuff like keys, mouse press, mouse move.
You can see the positions of x and y based on where the mouse is on the screen

So that took me all day, but I learned a lot. 

## Conclusion

- I like this a lot. A lot of learning, and surprisingly makes a lot of sense thus far.
  I feel like I always learn more from these...sometimes way more than in class. Welp!
