## 5/8/17 - Learnin'

## TIL

I sort of didn't have an idea of exactly *what* a game engine was,
even though I appparently made one in Java before (whoops).

## So...

- To strengthen my understanding of C++, 
  started on this Game Engine one for C++.
  
- This is this tutorial by the [Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw). 
  He's pretty awesome.
  
- One of things I think I defintely have ahead of people in class is just pure mileage.
  A lot of people don't even have a Github, or if they do, it's pretty empty, or only filled
  with class homework. :(
  
## I'm trying. But a lot of it is just fun. 

I was up at three trying to solve some Katas on CodeWars. 
I also beat the head of my hackerspace's score. :)

- I don't get that at all...I think programming's fun, so it's always worthwhile 
  to learn something or build as many things as you can.
  
- I want to especially get better at:
 1.  C++
 2.  Haskell 
 3. Computational understanding in general:
 
    Things like Pointers, Category Theory, Type Theory, Combinatorial Logic, etc.
    
 4. The Scientific approach: LaTeX, being analytical and concise, thinking more than tap-tapping. 

- I think that those two languages will do something special for my ability if I keep learning them,
  in addition to whatever other stuff I *have* to learn (*cough JavaScript, Python, etc*).
  
- Some of the best people I've admired in terms of ability seem to gravitate towards those.
  I don't think it's enough for me to just *be a developer*. I want to be a *good* one. 
  So I try to keep learning, and definitely don't shut myself off from learning a new language,
  trying something out, etc. Especially at this stage, it's okay to fail. 

## Today's exploration -> Building a Game Engine 

In this particular one, there are neat tricks like:
  
- hold alt and you can drag and select a group of objects

"Tricks" are important if they make you less likely to make mistakes. 
When you're learning, and you don't know them, you tend to type *everything*. 
So you find yourself making more mistakes. 
I'm a pretty good typist (Thanks, Mavis Beacon!), but I think about efficiency a lot. 

## To start, we loaded Two main libraries:
  
 - [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/)
 
 - [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
 
## That took a while...

- You had to link them to your folders after unzipping them.
  Interestingly, *not* as painful as Java SDKs for me. 
  
I was surprised it all worked!

## Rendering 

Then we got some Colour in there

## ...and Rendering

Then we got a triangle rendered vertex by vertex

![ge_003](/images/ge_003.png)

And checked the resolution of our screen

![ge_004](/images/ge_004.png)

And then made sure our imaged scaled with the resized screen

![ge_005](/images/ge_005.png)

And tested stuff like keys, mouse press, mouse move.
You can see the positions of x and y based on where the mouse is on the screen

So that took me all day, but I learned a lot. 

## Conclusion

- I like this a lot. A lot of learning, and surprisingly makes a lot of sense thus far.
  I feel like I always learn more from these...sometimes way more than in class. Welp!
