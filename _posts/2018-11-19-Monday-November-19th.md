## The City With Which I've become Apathetic

## Why are you Always talking about events..but you live somewhere else?

- Ah, that's a *great* question. It is because although I do live in LA, I am not *of* LA, 
  in my generation-speak. Nothing about this town resonates with me. Its energy, its people,
  nothing about it *excites* me. 
- Sometimes I come back from a conference / workshop and I am jolted by the recognition of
  being back in LA. I find it difficult to speak to interact with people here in a meaningful
  way (my mentor and friends at JPL don't really count, because JPL itself is a very isolated
  place!). And I can't recall a recent time where I felt I "enjoyed a night out" or anything
  like that in LA. I do remember the last time I was exhausted by its people, and frustrated,
  just wanted to be back in my place. I have multiple memories like that.
- I ended up here because after school in New York, a big group of my friends moved here. 
  I liked New York, and had (and still have) a lot of friends there. They always ask me if I'll
  be back (no..the answer to that..is no). In
  some ways, it has been beneficial (eg, its proximity to Silicon Valley), but I really have
  not taken anything about this town seriously for years. My friend invited me to a "tech
  event" today, and I politely told her that I'd prefer to stay home looking at Youtube videos.
- A lot of the events that claim to be "tech" are either feeding grounds for the many bootcamps
  that reside here, or are geared towards front-end. For a while, I was part of a healthy data
  science group, and I enjoyed that a lot, but many of those persons ended up eventually being
  recruited away to that very place to which I commute quite frequently. And strangely,I can count
  on my fingers the number of local recruitments I've received. 
  
## You should chase opportunity

- I am a firm believer of this. Always give it a shot. You might fail, but the probability of
  your success increases if you go to the places where you will most likely get a break.
  I remind a good friend of mine of this every single day. 
- Strangely, this place has never felt like the land of opportunity for me. A friend once told
  me that LA is a land of nomads. That has always made sense to me, because I have met so 
  many people passing through, but not many of them stay. It isn't a place of staying. It has never stuck.
  
## In other news

- I received more grants from MSRI!! So it looks like I'll actually be there from January 28th to
  February 8th. There will be an opportunity for us to have roommates, even though they've given
  me quite a generous reimbursement offer. So I'll into that. I'm excited to spend close to two
  weeks at Berkeley. To see if it too, resonates with me. 
  
- I also bought Sandy's book, and was making my way through it. I missed the Haskell Utah Meetup
  tonight, but I've been recovering from a cold, recovering from the dentist (where I spent half
  the day) and enjoying completing all my PhD applications. For the next month, I'll be following
  up on what is needed to complete them according to *each school*, which is a headache, but
  I look at it with gusto. I have no home here. I am a nomad in this place. I'm excited for my next
  adventure. 
  
## And that's about it
