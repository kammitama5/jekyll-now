## Tomorrow is my Birthday :D

## I managed
- I managed to finish up a quiz, an assignment and install Android 3.0 for this workshop this upcoming Saturday.
  That was sort of a pain (especially Gradle), but Googs invited me to do the workshop, so why not?
  In the midst of that, there is our online PureScript Meetup. So....yeah. Thankfully PureScript
  records their meetings. Hopefully Googs has a nice, long lunch so I can watch some of the stream!
- I'm also volunteering to help out with Registration at [SCALE](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/16x).
- In the midst of that...Haskell. At night, I've been reading Denotational Semantics (the unabridged novel :D)

## Haskell
- I'm currently on chapter 4 of Haskellbook. So far, so good. It's on DataTypes. 
- I have Stack installed on various devices, particularly on a Windows machine, along with Notepad++. 
  
## Set-up
- Here is the code on Notepad++

- Solution works

- This is um..the simplest of simple-setups, I guess. I have it on a Linux machine, but this version of 
  Stack is on Windows. I had never done that before, so I'm happy it worked. 

## My thoughts so far
- Watching the streams and stuff has paid off so far. It's fun to work through.
- It's okay to re-read the chapter twice, in case you skipped something
- It's *really* *really* worthwhile to do the exercises. I'm not sure what a person who didn't
  do the exercises would get out of the book, quite honestly.
