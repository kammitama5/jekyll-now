## Helms-a-Lee!

## Yeup..went sailing again today!

- Man, was it fun! 

- I did get about 70 percent of my Programming done (due August 25th), so I'm a bit ahead.

- In the meantime, I'd like to get in sailing once to twice a week, and eventually do some racing.

## Some pics!

## This is Avanti. 

- She used to be called *Aurora*, but was bought by a private seller
  and fixed up and renamed *Avanti*. I was told to whom it may belong,
  but I'm not sharing (sorry, not on a public blog!).

  The colour of the rocks is the colour at the base (yeeech!)

## In a far away, distant land...
- There is a dolphin in the water! Yeah!!!!

- You can see the little black head peeping out from the water...

- He's a smart one! He knows where the food is! (great spot for food!)

## Really tired, but may post some code

## Random kata(s):

- Count up to number given, excluding evens (including number)

```
def kido_count(n):
    arr =[]
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 != 0:
            arr.append(i)
    return arr
```

- Return NaN if not a number, -1 if less than 1, 0 if 0 and if +ve, 1

```
function sign(number){
  if (isNaN(number) == true){
    return(NaN)
  }
  else if (number == 0){
    return(0)
  }
  else if (number < 0){
    return(-1)
  }
  else{
    return(1)
  }
 
  return 
}
```
- Return a string alphabetized

```
function alphabetOrder(str){
    var arr = []
    var result =""
    for (var i = 0; i < str.length; i++)
    {
      arr.push(str[i])
      
    }
    var b = arr.sort()
    var c = b.join("")
    //console.log(c)
    return c
}

```
