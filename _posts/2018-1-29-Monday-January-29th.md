## Weather Data

## Today I spent
- Half of my day trying to figure out if I could understand how to do rolling mean in Julia.
  I understand the algorithm, but I had some problems with my Types; I still don't quite get
  them in terms of compatability. So that's something I have to work on. I did find a lot
  of Quants use Julia, though! :D
  
- So I tried to just look at the data using Pandas instead.

## This is pretty much my Process

## So, waiting to hear
- What I can improve on, and to re-submit if need be

## Also
- I'm tasked with doing some exercises sent to me via a draft 
  of a Computational Verification book being written, from a
  gentleman at POPL. So I plan to do a bit of that this week
  (perhaps this evening).
  
- Also, getting into what I have to do for assignment two 
  and general Python review in preparation
