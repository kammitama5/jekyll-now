## Super Busy

## So I'm super busy!

## What I've been up to
- Doing coursework on my own on compilers (just this week, then back to Nanodegree)
- Reading a bit of the paper I'm assigned (there are some exercises I have to work through, but also
  some fundamental concepts I am learning along the way). Particularly SKI calculus and Kleene algebra.
- Coincidentally, I bought a book by [Kleene on Mathematical Logic](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Logic-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486425339), so I will be going through that over summer.
- Studying for an interview next week. I'm just going to do my best. The contact for the interview has 
  been super professional (another large company!) and I'm being interviewed by two engineers.
- Watching the occasional Haskell stream *really* late at night (went to sleep at midnight because of this).
  I learn quite a bit, and it's helping in terms of just reading code and seeing others debug, so it's been really
  helpful.

## Next week
- Get back on the Nanodegree track
- Keep studying for interview
- I am meeting with some other ladies I met online who are into Data Science next Saturday. That should be fun.
- I have sailing meeting with dinner. That will be a nice break, but it depends, since it's the night before my 
  interview so I may actually skip and opt for rest instead (and studying). We'll see.
