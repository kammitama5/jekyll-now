## Moving on

- I discovered [LambdaCast](https://soundcloud.com/lambda-cast), and have been listening to this wonderful podcast.

- Right now (as we speak), I'm on Immutability.
  
- When I'm done with that, I'm going to the [Type Theory one](http://typetheorypodcast.com/) :) 

## Plans moving forward

- I was supposed to attend this Meetup last night that was focused on data,
  but I got there and didn't feel welcome, so I left. The saddest part is that
  it was specifically geared towards women engineers. It just goes to show that 
  inclusion isn't just about gender. 
  
- I'm actually in a lot of Meetup groups that tend to be majority-male, and 
  I've never really felt excluded. It was always just a fit, in terms of personality
  and what we were interested in, so the rest of our differences really didn't matter.
  Maybe I'm just an optimist :)
  
  
## Coding for Product

- I have to write an accumulator function. Shouldn't be too bad.
  Meanwhile, we have to set up our database (probably POSTGRES; we switched from Mongo), 
  but the UI is mostly finished.
  
## Nanodegree

- I'm still ahead, but working on one problem I really want to solve. I'm still more
  than a month ahead of the deadline (about 5-6 weeks ahead), so...
  
## Sailing

- Yes, I *am* going sailing: both this Saturday and next Sunday (we have one Sunday off).
  It's pretty much part of who I am right now. I look forward to it and hope to continue for
  the rest of my life.
  
## Upcoming stuff

- I'm going to SF this Thursday for training, and then have another event at the end of the month,
  again in SF. So Twice a month. And then a few days later, going to Vegas for DEF CON (woohoo!)
  
## Things I stumbled upon that I'd like to learn a bit about:

- [Co-induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinduction)

- [Arrow symbol in mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_category)
