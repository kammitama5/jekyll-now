## Moving on

- I discovered [LambdaCast](https://soundcloud.com/lambda-cast), and have been listening to this wonderful podcast.

- Right now (as we speak), I'm on Immutability.
  
- When I'm done with that, I'm going to the [Type Theory one](http://typetheorypodcast.com/) :) 

## Plans moving forward

- I was supposed to attend this Meetup last night that was focused on data,
  but I got there and didn't feel welcome, so I left. The saddest part is that
  it was specifically geared towards women engineers. It just goes to show that 
  inclusion isn't just about gender. 
  
- I'm actually in a lot of Meetup groups that tend to be majority-male, and 
  I've never really felt excluded. It was always just a fit, in terms of personality
  and what we were interested in, so the rest of our differences really didn't matter.
  Maybe I'm just an optimist :)
  
  
## Coding for Product

- I have to write an accumulator function. Shouldn't be too bad.
  Meanwhile, we have to set up our database (probably POSTGRES; we switched from Mongo), 
  but the UI is mostly finished.
  
## Nanodegree

- I'm still ahead, but working on one problem I really want to solve. I'm still more
  than a month ahead of the deadline (about 5-6 weeks ahead), so...
  
## Sailing

- Yes, I *am* going sailing: both this Saturday and next Sunday (we have one Sunday off).
  I *may* also be doing a three-day weekend of sailing to Catalina Island.
  
- It's pretty much part of who I am right now. I look forward to it and hope to continue for
  the rest of my life.
  
## Upcoming stuff

- I'm going to SF this Thursday for training, and then have another event at the end of the month,
  again in SF. So Twice a month. And then a few days later, going to Vegas for DEF CON (woohoo!)
  
## Things I stumbled upon that I'd like to learn a bit about:

- [Co-induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinduction)

- [Arrow symbol in mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_category)

- [Hindley-Milner (or "Damas-Milner") type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system). 
  One of the first Papers We Love talks I ever attended was on this. There were a lot of Haskellinos there :)
  
- I saw a sharp sign (sharp like musical notation) after Gamma notation in a paper. Didn't know you could do that.

- [Monotonocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function). This I think I understand, but would like to do
  more reading on applications.
  
- [Lemmas](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Lemma.html). Yes, it's a proof. 

- [Bell-LaPadula model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%E2%80%93LaPadula_model)

- Reynold's algorithm. The most famous is the [algorithm of Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids)

- [Localized endomorphisms](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/localized+endomorphism)

- [Parametric polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism) vs Ad hoc polymorphism (think of function overloading in C++)

- [Anaphora and Dynamic Skolemization](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:RF8W9mT5Ym8J:https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~schubert/papers/dynamic-skolemization.ps+&cd=11&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) : applications to Linguistics

## Reading recommendations:

- [Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Books/ProgLangs/2007-04-26/plai-2007-04-26.pdf)

## Yes, I'm a two-year old

- I have a lot of questions!
