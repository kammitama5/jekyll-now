## My first Twitter ML event and a round of interviews!

## Hello there! I'm back in LA! 

- Tonight, I'm hanging out with my mentor at JPL. 
  We'll be having Chinese dumplings and listening to Jazz :)
  
## Firstly...Tuesday Interviews

- Randomly, one of the companies had contacted me ahead of time. 
  They also sent me 11 positions they thought I'd be a fit for within their company.
  
- There was one (actually a Big Four company) that really liked me. The guy
  who was interviewing (now a Manager, was an engineer; he said there was *no*
  way someone would go from being a Manager there without some sort of technical
  background, which I thought was *amazing*!
  
- The guy said that I sounded *exactly* like all of their engineers, in terms
  of the things I'm interested in, and my passion. Also, what caught his interest
  was when I said I liked puzzles (see my CodeWars repo on GH). He was in shock,
  as was I. I thought they would be a pain to speak with, having the clout that
  they do, but I was actually *most* impressed by that company. They have a 
  University Programme internally, to get their engineers up to speed, so 
  took my resume and said he'd look into it to see if they could find something for me.
  Honestly, it would be an honour to work for them. 
  
- There was another great company that was a lot smaller, but they required me to be a
  US citizen. But they really really liked me! They build exoskeletons, and do a mix of
  hardware and software, so pretty much up my tree :) I told them I'd be back..as a citizen (haha).
  
## Wednesday...Twitter

- Wednesday was FUN! I took the 6:30am bus up. 
  One guy almost got left behind and started waving furiously at the front of the bus 
  "You're leaving me!!!". He was in a wifebeater, too, which made it all the more hilarious.
  The bus driver was nice enough to make another round while the guy got his stuff at the station
  (the driver specifically said be on the bus 11am, and it was 11:05). Never a dull moment.
