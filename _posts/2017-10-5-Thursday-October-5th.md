## PureScript Night recap

- Tuesday night, we had our first PureScript Meetup!

## Here are some of my notes!

## JS issues ... why PureScript 

- JS had for Phil, and inability to reason about code
- scaling up/ getting up to speed with a large code-base is often difficult
- PureScript produces minimal and easily readable JS 
- it doesn't contain bloated libraries; you use more of only what you need
- Haskell beginners can contribute 
- it has a fast runtime system
- strong expressive types 
- there is more predictability of code from PureScript to JS

## Why he wrote a language vs taking it off the shelf 

- TypeScript/Flow vs PureScript 
  - real row polymorphism from type checker
  - ADTs
  
- Haste/Fay
  - Fay didn't include typeclasses support
  - GHCJS was not easy to read for JS team
  - didn't have runtime
  - Roy (programming language) was the closest that satisfied what he wanted
  
## Resources 

- Pursuit - PureScript documentation (built with Yesod)
  - PureScript Contrib
  - PureScript Node
  - PureScript web 
  
- Core libraries 
  - !!YPER (server side rendered), uses type system to enforce certain things
  - Pux (for front end applications)
  - PureScript Halogen (100% PureScript)
  
## Applications

- [Slamdata](https://slamdata.com/) has 100% PureScript on front end (developed Halogen)
- Quicktype -IDL
- [Insect](https://insect.sh/) (a personal favourite of mine! )

## Getting Started 

- install pureScript contrib
- most people use ```pulp```
- book (PureScript by example)
- Getting started with PureScript (pureScript documentation)

## Future Work

- ApplicativeDo
- SAT Solvers (constraints/ solutions)
- parsing JSON
- argonaut
- simple generics 

## CodeGen talk 

- [Brady](https://github.com/tippenein) did a talk on using CodeGen in PureScript from Haskell Types 

## After Meetup-hangout

- We went out for drinks afterwards at the Arts District Brewery. It was really fun!
  Phil was also kind enough to give two of us a ride home. :)
  I have a lot of great expectations for this group!

## This led to my writing my first PureScript programme!

- I started a [repo](https://github.com/kammitama5/PureScript-playground) with such projects, as I continue attending
  the Meetup and work on PureScript on my own.
  
## On my own

- started going through the [documentation](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read) 

## Easy to get set up

- It's surprisingly easy to get up and running with PureScript.
  Here is checking the type of "map".

- They have you do Euler question number 1. I've done it in Python before,
  so that was my comparison

- The prompt upon leaving

- Obligatory "Hello World" in PureScript

- installing pureScript-global and browsing the module

- solution for my exercise from my first programme

## Katas

- Find number of non-even substrings in a string integer

```
def solve(s):
  arr = []
  import itertools
  a = (s[i:j] for i, j in itertools.combinations(xrange(len(s)+1), 2))
  for i in a:
    if int(i) % 2 != 0:
      arr.append(i)
  return len(arr)
```

- Find number in word and return its integer equivalent

```
function findNum(n){
  result = 0
  n = n.toLowerCase()
  var a = n.replace(/[^\w\s!.]/g,'');
  var b = a.replace(/ /g,'')
  for (var i = 0; i < b.length; i++){
    if (b.indexOf('one') !== -1){
      result = 1
    }
    else if (b.indexOf('two') !== -1){
      result = 2 
    }
    else if (b.indexOf('three') !== -1){
      result = 3
    }
    else if (b.indexOf('four') !== -1){
      result = 4
    }
    else if (b.indexOf('five') !== -1){
      result = 5
    }
    else if (b.indexOf('six') !== -1){
      result = 6
    }
    else if (b.indexOf('seven') !== -1){
      result = 7
    }
    else if (b.indexOf('eight') !== -1){
      result = 8
    }
    else if (b.indexOf('nine') !== -1){
      result = 9
    }
    else if (b.indexOf('ten') !== -1){
      result = 10
    }
  }
  return result
}
```
- take an array, sort it in desc order and add liftoff essentially

```
function liftoff(instructions){
    instructions = instructions.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    var a = instructions.reverse()
    var b  = a.join(' ') + ' liftoff!'
    return(b)
}
```
- collatz conjecture..count how long it takes number to reach it...

```
def get_collatz(n):
    #print n 
    count = 0 
    while (not n == 1):
      if n % 2 == 0:
        n = n / 2 
        count = count + 1 
      else:
        n = (3 * n) + 1 
        count = count + 1 
    return count
```

- return day given digit eg 1 == Monday, etc

```
function whatday(num) { 
  if ((num) == 1){
    return 'Sunday'
  }
  else if ((num == 2)){
    return 'Monday'
  }
  else if ((num == 3)){
    return 'Tuesday'
  }
    else if ((num == 4)){
    return 'Wednesday'
  }
  else if ((num == 5)){
    return 'Thursday'
  }
    else if ((num == 6)){
    return 'Friday'
  }
    else if ((num == 7)){
    return 'Saturday'
  }
  else{
    return 'Wrong, please enter a number between 1 and 7'
  }
```
- check if string includes 'tree fiddy' or '3.50' or 'three fifty'

```
function isLockNessMonster(s) {
    var a = 'tree fiddy'
    var b = '3.50'
    var c = 'three fifty'
    
    if (s.includes(a) || s.includes(b) || s.includes(c)){
      return true
    }
      else{
        return false
      }
    return
}
```
