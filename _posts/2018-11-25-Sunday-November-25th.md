## Digging into Continuation Monad

## Wut

- Today, I spent the day trying to get a sense of a couple things. 
  - Continuation Monad
  - CPS (Continuation passing style)
  - SECD
  
- I spent the day doing a fair amount of reading, and plodding along in [Sandy's Types](https://leanpub.com/thinking-with-types) book.
  It was a long and tough struggle, because a lot of it was dealing with the constant reminder that I'm not anywhere
  where I'd like to be yet. I am learning a lot and it's definitely stretching me, and I spend a lot of time just trying
  to get things to work. However, it is a book that I plan to spend time on re-reading when I get better at Haskell.
  For example, I definitely am not able to complete *all* of the exercises in the book right now. I do the best I can
  at the moment.
  
- Bear in mind that I had *no* idea what any of these things were (listed above) before today. 
  I have a better understanding, and find some (eg SECD and Krivine) to be *fascinating*.
  I will list a list of resources I read up on today (or at least looked at) below. I pretty much went through
  and took a pass from beginning to end of these resourced listed (below) today. 
  
## Feelings of Not being good enough

- I constantly feel this. I've run into some situations where I've felt like people were competing with me, 
  (in one particular incident, I realized only afterwards that the person in particular was doing anything they
  could to prevent me from gaining more experience, even though such person had a CS degree, a great GPA and 
  great job prospects) and I am perpetually perplexed by this because in my mind,
  I am the *quintessential underdog*. I've gotten this far solely by trying to outwork the person next to me.
  But maybe one day, it won't be enough. 
  I don't have a CS degree, and I'm out of my mind for applying to grad school,
  but I *want* to be there. I just need to convince *someone* that I will be worth a spot there. I'm competing 
  constantly with people who are in a better position, so I usually expect disappointment. But I keep going because
  I don't see myself doing any other thing. And what is a life if you don't try, right?

## Recources

- I perused these today. I *loved* the BRICS one, and the Stack Overflow answer, as well as Landin's paper.
  What I especially liked is that these particular papers are about *ideas* and are not swimming in PL notation,
  so they were a lot easier for me to follow. I'm not a Scheme expert, so some of the code took a bit of time to
  follow (eg in the SECD paper that showed its evaluation-dump process), but it was still reasonable if I spoke 
  it out loud.

  ## I've mostly downloaded and bookmarked these
  
  - But I'd like to come back to them as I gain a better understanding.
