## PLMW and Open Source

## It's still April, but I'm writing this anyways!

- I received two surprises today:
  - I've been asked to be a part of this summer's "Increasing Rust's Reach" commitment to Open Source.
    This means I'll be working on a Rust project (specifically, CLI) that is open source. I will also
    have a mentor, whose name is Aaron. He lives in Dublin, so that's going to be interesting!
    I'll have to balance that with my Haskell open source project, but this project specifically asks
    for just 3 to 5 hours a week, and in return, will provide me with a free ticket, room and board to a
    Rust conference of my choice. So that's really exciting! One of them is in Paris! :D
    I'm particularly excited about this because I'd like to continue contributing to Open Source,
    and the Rust community is great and complementary to the Haskell community (there is a *lot* of overlap).
    I won't say this explicitly because I have no evidence, but I think that doing both will help me become
    a better problem-solver and a better programmer.
  - Secondly, I've been invited to participate in my first PLMW workshop! This is great news, because it is an opportunity
    to be meet with peers and be mentored by professionals in research. So I'm pretty psyched.
    
## I'm also booked for OPLSS
- I'm booked for OPLSS, so that's taken care of. I will have to book the flight later on, but that will be fine
- In the meantime, I will be spending all of my time on Haskell. I have a pull request to work on tomorrow
  with regards to a build error, and then I want to also keep working through Haskell material.
  
## My general time
- Since I have to dedicate about 3 to 5 hours, I figure I can dedicate my Sundays to this, and spend the rest of my
  week on Haskell. Fair enough. It will also be a testament to whether learning both is really worthwhile. I've seen
  the question often about whether a person should learn one or the other. So we'll see after this summer.
  
## I'm really excited
- I'm excited by how much encouragement the community has given to me. I'm really grateful. I'm really honoured by how
  many amazing people have reached out to help me along my way. I could have never imagined a better summer. It's going
  to be very tough, but I'm willing to put in the effort. It will make me a better programmer and tougher in general,
  and that is fine by me.
