## What are the Metrics we are measuring?

## I had a discussion lately
- I had a discussion lately with a friend in which we were discussing the number of Academic and industry partnerships
  to get more underrepresented persons in tech or in Academia. In their usual brilliance, they said that the issue
  wasn't that persons were struggling to get in to such spaces, but that the attrition rate was awful.
- And it's true. It's a lazy metric to pay attention to only the process of admittance, rather than looking at long-term
  attrition.
  
## My adventures in OWASP
- I've slowly been finding myself, with a lot more free time, fascinated by secure computation, particularly MPC. 
  I've been working on a small project, and spending my free tie looking at the videos. Somewhere along the way,
  it reminded me of my time in LA, when I was curious about the world of OWASP and was considering whether I did enjoy
  the world of forensics and ethical hacking. 
- I had been to a few meetups run by [Peter](https://www.amazon.com/The-Hacker-Playbook-Practical-Penetration/dp/1494932636/)
  and to be honest, it was interesting, but I realized that I liked privacy, encryption and data a lot more than I did security,
  even though people often confuse the two. However, along the way, I was still figuring things out.
- In one Meetup, I attempted to go, but figured out that it would take me around 3 hours each way to attend. When I got there,
  I couldn't find the place after a good hour of looking, so I settled in the nearby library instead. Realizing that the last bus for the day was coming in
  20 minutes, I turned around and went home (I couldn't afford a taxi and didn't own a smart phone so taking a rideshare or taxi
  was out of the question for me). 
- When I got back, I received a rude email from the host of the Meetup telling me that "when I was serious" I should consider 
  emailing him, and was subsequently kicked out of the Meetup group. It's funny to think about now, because I'm on the fringes
  of that community. However, I think about instances like that and what it means for attrition for persons who are legitmiately interested,
  and really just need help or support. What if instead of that treatment, the person had helped pool resources with someone who also had 
  an interest (a regular of the group) who could meet me halfway at a location, or something like that?
  
## My adventures in Haskell
- I think about some of these things when I think about some of my experiences in Haskell, too. Sometimes, I used to get upset that I wasn't
  further along, but some things came up along the way that were legitimately blockers to my learning. There were legitimately persons and 
  opportunities (or lack thereof) that hindered the process for me, and it was frustrating.
- However, at the same time, there were also people who reached out to me. There was Phil, who went out of his way to offer a ride back to
  my neighbourhood to both myself and another person in our group. This ensured that it was easier for us to *show up*. There was also 
  food, which made it easier for persons like myself who weren't making a lot at the time and couldn't afford to buy food in the expensive 
  startup neighbourhood of Santa Monica or Playa Vista (where many of the events were held) to be there. It sounds trivial, but these things
  make a difference to people starting out.

## Opportunity
- I was looking at an (unfortunate) Residency a few days ago and saw that no one in the group of persons they had chosen looked like me.
  Also, all the persons they had picked came from schools with an outpouring of opportunities and support. It never makes sense to me that
  on one hand, these organizations and institutions talk about opportunity and diversity and representation, while their actions seem to say
  the opposite. As a friend of mine years ago said of a conference "It makes no sense that they give us free tickets to all these conferences
  that are sponsored by all these tech companies, if they don't intend to hire us". And it's true. It becomes more of a dog and pony show
  than anything that really intends to make a real difference.
- At the end of the day, the long-term impact and rates of attrition tell a clear story. It's hypocrisy. They don't want us. We are merely
  window-dressing. But it's okay; the ones who make it through will start their own communities. We will succeed in spite of you. 
  
## And that's it.
