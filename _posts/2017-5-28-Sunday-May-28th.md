## On the Way Home

## I'm still in the Airport

- Very tired, but with some free time, hoping to finish up 
  my Lambda Conf Experience.
  
## Social

- I decided to do the tea-time, because it was best for my schedule.

- I got to hang out with Lyle Kopnicky, who was cool enough 
  to *study* Programming Language Theory for his Master's. 
  He was really interesting to talk to, and had some really [great
  projects](http://www.vintage-basic.net/games.html) to show.
  
- He basically *made* Vintage Basic, an interpreter
  for old school games in BASIC...in Haskell, which is *amazing*! 
  This is just something he did for the fun of it!
  He's a mutual friend to quite a few 
  Haskellinos in our group, so we've run into each other
  again and again throughout the conference.
  
- In the past, I was *so* stalking his Category Theory/
  PDX Functional Programming group, though. Really great stuff!
  
## Tea Time pics
- This was at Dushanbe, which was gracious enough 
  to provide us with a wonderful Tea Breakfast for
  LambdaConf Social pre-conference activities!
