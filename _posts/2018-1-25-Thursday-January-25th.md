## Explorer 1 : 60 years later

## Hello from JPL!
- I made it to the Explorer 1 lecture! :D

- Actually, we firstly went to eat some dumplings, and chatted about 
  the Algorithm W, which I was unfamiliar with until today. 
  I mean, I've heard of [Hindley-Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system), but right now there are chunks
  that I understand, and some things I don't know that I don't know.
  But it's fascinating. 
- I like the way my mentor thinks. He doesn't focus on libraries (I've *never* heard him mention any), and he may mention 
  a programming language only as a historical reference or as something that is interesting or unique about it, or how it led
  to a new way of thinking about something. He's a mathematician who works with software, and it really has informed the way
  he uses software, because at his core, he is a problem-solver who uses mathematics and software as a *tool*.
- I saw a lovely video today about this on Programmers vs Scientists and what each can learn from the other. 
  It's called ["The Two Cultures of Programming"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3iR_PknlFc), by Joshua Ballanco.
  Very interesting. 
- There was a lively chat about Data from Satellites, Data Visualization and Explorer 1.

## I also wandered around
- And took some photos of some new additions to the Exhibit at Von Karman.
These guys!

## It was a really fun night!
- Oh, and during the day, I managed to get Julia installed off-line and run on
  a notebook, but ```Plotly``` is giving me some issues. So I have to resolve those.
- But so far, so good. I should be able to resolve some plot issues online as well. 
  Hopefully.
- This weekend is Sparklecon, and then I settle down to do some of my Nanodegree assignments
  (hopefully two in the next two weeks). 
- And of course, there is sailing (and living on a boat) on Thursday through Sunday! :D
