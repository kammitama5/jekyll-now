## Projects in between Summer and Fall

- I'm wrapping up class next week Tuesday,
  so starting to think already of what I can 
  do to keep my C++ skills current.
  
- One of the things I have in mind is making
  an Asteroid game in C++.
  
- I know, I have many friends who would roll their 
  eyes at how easy this is for them, but hey,
  I'm learning. I've done it in Python before. 
  But, with help (ie some library or IDE that helps you),
  vs C++, which would be from scratch, 
  and it was a while ago (like in 2013).
  
- A heads up; this may be a colossal failure.
  However, I defnitely will learn *something*, which is the point.
  
## Some notes

- Was doing some research, and came across this book,
  "Game Programming Patterns", by Robert Nystrom. 
  Free pdf link is [here](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/sample.pdf)
  
## And..solved some Katas

- Three different languages today! 

## I won't even bother to explain them, because they're straight-forward.

## Python

```
def greet(name): #finish the function greet
    try:
        return "Hey " + name + "!";
    except:
        return "Hey " + str(name) + "!";
```

## Ruby 

```
def countWords(str)
  return str.split.size
end
```

## Java

```
class Upper{
  public static String MakeUpperCase(String str){
    return str.toUpperCase();
  }
}
```

## UnBootcamp

- Finished assignment and pull request accepted / closed.
  Firebase was *really* fun!

## Also

- There is talk about a Mathematics for Computer Science Meetup.
  That would be neat. Possibly on Fridays. We'd probably start
  with Linear Algebra or Algebra 1 or something. 
  
- Also, Category Theory, possibly though my Haskell group. 

## I know

- I have other projects in the works that I spoke about doing.
  That's okay. It's a process, and as I learn, I'll add / complete,
  and document my progress.
  
- The point is to learn and continue to get better. 
  Also, to keep my skills in C++ fresh. 
  I should have taken the class I'm taking in Fall *first*,
  but oh well. I learned a lot in this current class I'm
  wrapping up. And I survived.
  I've heard the pace of the one in Fall is slower, 
  so things from this one will become clearer, which 
  is good. Either way, I'd like to keep going and continue
  with Python, JS, C++ and Haskell. Learn a little Coq, 
  Idris and Mathematical Notation along the way, too.
  
## Later

- Hanging out with the Germans at JPL. Should be fun! 
  This one is special because they only found out a few 
  days ago that I got approved for my application process,
  which means if all goes well, I should be on my way to 
  a possible internship next Spring (we shall see)!
