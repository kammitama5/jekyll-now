## Privacy 1.0

## You've been kind of quiet
- Yes, I have actually! It's been because my sleep schedule is kind of random these days; I stay up late (and I mean, often until 4 or 5am) and get up
  around 11am. I take a mid-afternoon / mid-evening map and start it all over again!
- I also got tired of being freaked out by people wanting to know what I was up to 24 / 7. My family is pretty private, and I'm also pretty private,
  so when it overwhelmingly becomes a situation where I'm crowded for information on what I'm up to, I'll retreat and just stay away from everything.
- The lovely thing about quarantine (at least for me) is being able to disappear and do focused work, not having anyone know where you are (well, except
  my advisor, because well, that's my boss lol). But it's been quite lovely!
  
  
## Recent Adventures
- I finished up my Esoteric Languages club, and am midway through my Ostrom Economics Computing class. 
- I started my Cryptography Maths class and my Privacy Law class. Cryptography is awesome and now I think I want to continue with another class after
  this one. The teacher is also awesome. 
- I'm also auditing a class at Stanford, and that one is awesome, too. It's on blockchain protocols and internet scale consensus.
- Finally, I'm doing a mentorship with another student (who is finishing up her PhD at another East Coast school) and a Google Research mentor (also based on the East Coast). I heard from my mentor today. She works at [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.google.com/). We will all meet later this week.
- Paperwork has also started coming in for my summer internship. As usual, large companies usually mean drowning in paperwork, but I've been quite impressed
  so far by both the culture and people I've met, and the persons helping us through the process. I'm convinced that companies that make things or deal with physical constraints (aka hardware, distributed systems)
  are more my thing, both in terms of the type of work and the general culture. I've also been hanging out with a lot of gearheads, electronics people, cryptocurrency people (as in, they develop or do research in that field and are super enthusiastic about that sort of stuff) and graphics programmers on Discord. But maybe a company that just does software as a service or something will convince me otherwise. I'm open.

## Finally
- I started hanging out with a bunch of West Coast people who use and are learning R, and it's been fantastic. The fields range from Physics to Biostatistics
  to Mathematics and everything in between. Most are either in PhD programmes or have completed and are in Post-docs, or working as statisticians. The quality
  is excellent (our most recent workshop was headed by a tenured professor at a California University with a strong statistics programme), and as it turns out, one of the organizers went to my school for his PhD (which was not originally in stats, but that's what he does anyways; he's a pretty experienced and knowledgeable Principal Data Scientist).
- It's really refreshing because I'm really against any kind of gatekeeping with respect to learning, and I've felt that the whole departmental structure 
  can sometimes incentivize gatekeeping. So this is a breath of fresh air in comparison, and I find myself staying up late and chatting with a friend who is
  also taking a stats course (who did his PhD in Anthropology).
- Today I also had an hour-long chat with my Mathematics professor, and she is not only awesome, but also very supportive. She's also absolutely geeky and fun,
  and makes me laugh. I love her!
- I think it's amazing and really cool that people can all use statistics but with different lenses. They think about analyzing data in different ways, and some
  models are more common than others. Right now, I'm right at the intersection of encryption and statistics, and I'm really enjoying it. 
  
## Thoughts
- I have kind of laid low on recruitment for the past few weeks, even though I had still been getting opportunities. I started feeling like I didn't want to do
  any, and as one of my mentors and friends advised me, it takes a lot of resources to pull people away and interview them while they do their job, so if you
  aren't committed and pretty deep into the process, you should let them know and not waste their time. So this is the first season I really just started saying
  no to people. More of a "Thanks, but maybe another time". I got a lot more exhausted by people trying to book back to back interviews and eventually just tapped
  out, which was a different experience and a little empowering. 
- I also got more exposure this year to fields that weren't just tech. In the past, I'd get recruitment from other companies outside of tech, but to be honest,
  in California, it just feels different, because you're almost incentivized to go with the flow and aim for tech (generally; I understand that some people don't
  want to do this and aim for other areas like entertainment, insurance, gaming, aerospace, etc). So I've been considering that in terms of where I'd like to look
  next for a possible internship, but I'm still not sure. 
- Otherwise, I've quite frankly been enjoying solitude a lot. I hang out a lot on Discord, and a couple Slack groups from time to time, and there are some regular
  friends who message me, but things have just been great.
  
## And that's it
