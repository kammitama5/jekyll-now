- Was in class going through Frameworks and Databases
  and saw the SpaceX Mission got scrubbed to Monday. Oh well...

## Learned about Databases 

- This was actually my favourite! Enjoyed this a lot.

- Was familiar with mySQL, Oracle and BigQuery, and a bit of Neo4j.

- Databases just make sense to me :)

## Katas

- Write ax^2 + bx + c 

```
y = (a * (x * x)) + (b * x) + c
```

## Things to do 

- Udacity Nanodegree continue (I may start this on Monday).
