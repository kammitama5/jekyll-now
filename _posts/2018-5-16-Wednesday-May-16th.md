## Day 3 GSoC

## It's 12am
- I should totally be sleeping, but I'm up listening to ["Randy"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw3d9KTYHIE) before I head to sleep and get up again in a few hours :D 
- I'm officially listed as a contributor! How cool is that!? *slow clap*

## I'm also stuck
- I'm stuck on this one resolution of types that I'm going to work on tomorrow during the day. If I can't get it to work,
  I guess I'm going to have to walk into that meeting tomorrow at 7pm and get some help. Either way, it shall be conquered!
  *insert arbitrary Trogdor dance*. So reminded me of a few years ago, when I was playing Trogdor and my dad asked me what 
  I was doing, and I calmly replied "setting peasants and their cottages afire" and he said with great interest and sarcasm "Oh..wonderful!" LOL.
  
## Also Rust
- I'm trying to understand some of the beginner stuff, and make a small project this week. We'll see. Some of it is very familiar from
  Python, Haskell and C++, but it's still not a language I'd say I'm fluent in, so working on that. Haskell is definitely helping, though.
  
## I'm looking forward to the meeting today
- It was a great idea to have the meetings throughout the week to make sure I have tasks assigned and am focused. I don't know how 
  these mentors find the time and energy to do this, considering they're also working. They were up at all hours. I hope they get some
  rest!
- I have class, for which I sort of missed last Wednesday (was at IO) and Monday (on-site). I worked on a quiz yesterday but I have two 
  assignments coming up, so we'll see. I have to say though, Haskell and Rust are more fun. It's been easier to do those rather than 
  homework for class. But I guess considering this class makes me a student and the last class is the week after LambdaConf, I guess
  I should just finish it off.
