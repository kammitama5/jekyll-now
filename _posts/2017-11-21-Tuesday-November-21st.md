## Moon Man and an Interview Tip Meetup

## Hiya everyone! 
- It's Thanksgiving Week! That means...I can stay home and work!
  Yayeeee!
  
## I've been working on Moon Man!

- I hoping to add gravity and stuff, but essentially, the goal
  would be to colonize the moon.

- This is the planet. It has gravity and stuff

- I need to scale moon-man better, of course, and add physics and stuff

- He has a little flag that you can collect at some point and get to 
  a point to colonize

- Come on now...are you surprised? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Maybe next I can make
  an asteroid-drilling game with flying asteroids and stuff. lol. 
  This is super-simple, though, and it's being built using SFML.

## I also finished the Nanodegree

- Yup..I have one final project to do, but that's pretty much it!

- Also, I decided to learn some JQuery on CodeCademy, just because I didn't think
  I understood it well enough in the course. Event listeners were sort of straight-
  forard, though. Maybe because I've done them before in Java or something? Dunno.
  
## Upcoming...

- Going to continue working on the game. Figuring out key presses and some physics (Moon gravity!).
  Building a menu so the user can quit and stuff.
  
## I've also been scheduling and rescheduling interviews with a few companies. It's kind of like
   one a day each day (including one from an investment bank! My first haha. I'm only mentioning 
   because my brother works at one). I'm just going to try to do my best. I really want to intern 
   at NASA first, though (I know that sounds weird, but I really do!)
   
## And that's it...actually....(well actually haha)

- I'm going to be in SF on the 2nd for a PCB workshop, and then I head to Maryland the next day.
  That's in a week and a half from now. So def posting up some pics and a write-up on that. Ugh. Snow!
