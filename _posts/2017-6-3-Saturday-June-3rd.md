## First Day of June Unbootcamp

## Making a Study-Buddy App

## Basically

- This Unbootcamp is focused on creating
  a project and working together as a team.
  It's for four Saturdays, pretty much 
  all-day (9 to 6pm).
  
- So getting used to making pull requests,
  merging and dealing with conflicts, 
  coming up with ideas, using JavaScript, 
  HTML and CSS to make a project.
  
## So Firstly...

- We did some brainstorming of ideas

- First, we started with our original ideas

## Implementation

Then, we implemented basic code for the first Mock-up of the Profile Page

- Things we needed

## Wrote some Code in CodePen

- Translated to be pushed to the central Repo

## And made a nicer Profile Page for User Sign-up/ Sign In

- This is based on our Options (1, 2, 3)

## Melanie and myself churned out this Page, based on Option 1.

- The Cat would be a gif, essentially.

## Also 

I solved Covfefe kata, along with two new friends, Allie and Kelly

```
function covfefe(str)
{
  // 

  if (str.includes("coverage"))
  {
    var textTitle = "coverage"
    var str = str.replace(/coverage/g, 'covfefe');
  }
  else {
    str = str + " covfefe";
  }
   //console.log(str)
    return str;
}

```

- And...my 2000th commit today!
