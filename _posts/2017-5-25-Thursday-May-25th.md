## LambdaConf Day One : Category Theory

## Hello from Boulder
![lc1_001](/images/lc1_001.png)

- Officially made it and went to my first day. It was awesome.
  There was so much to choose from.

## I chose Category Theory (all day Session)

- This was with David Spivak, who is a researcher at MIT.
  He was fantastic. I'm new to a lot of this, and I was
  definitely stretched mentally, but I also learned a lot.
  
## I wrote notes in LaTeX.

- I'll try to align the notes as best I can with images he drew

## Finally

- We went out to eat at this indian restaurant, and even continued
  talking about Category Theory there, in Haskell and F#!

## Plan for tomorrow

- Interested in either learning Coq or Lambda Calculus. 
  Saturday, I have to make Sandy's talk and Runar's, if I can!
  Really great day today :)
