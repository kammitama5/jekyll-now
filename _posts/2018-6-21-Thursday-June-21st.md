## GSoC and RustReach Day 39

## I got up early
- I was working registration from 7:30am to 11am today as a student volunteer. However,
  we got to sit in on Erik's talk! His slides were kind of amazing! :D My friend, Sahil,
  from India, later asked him what software he used to make the drawings, and he said
  "pen and paper" :D
