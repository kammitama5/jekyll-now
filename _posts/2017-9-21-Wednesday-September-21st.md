## Sailing practice and upcoming 

## Got my gloves! 

- Wohoo! My sailing gloves arrived in the mail last night.
  Got them when I got home last night (about to to midnight..argh. 
  Blargy train schedule!)
  
- So heading over there to do some practice and figure out where 
  I'll be on Sunday and all that. 
  
## Got a lot going on

- I have a C++ assignment to do by Oct 3rd
- A solution to upload that is a mini-version of that
- Finish up lectures for Nanodegree by Oct 1st,
  so I have 1 month for the final project 
- Stick with going through Haskell lessons on Mondays
  (usually takes up most of the day)
- Find a way to continue doing some C (probably once the 
  Nanodegree is done; will be a natural complement to C++...
  uh..I hope :P )

## Been a bit busy

- I've been hearing from recruiters once a day, 
  so been following up with some
  
- Also filling out some applications for some other stuff 

- I have a habit of putting some of my kata solutions 
  on old posts (which I did for my previous post),
  so some of the ones I worked on the last couple of days 
  on there
  
- Oh, and I joined a [PureScript](https://www.meetup.com/LA-PureScript/) group! 

## Upcoming things I'd like to read

- How [garbage collectors work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection) and the mark-sweep algorithm.
  I'd like to learn about the algorithms 
  and data structures used. 
  There's a guy in our FP chat group who implemented his own from scratch, which is amazeballs! 
  A lot of it is in C, so that's perfect, 
  considering I'm learning a bit of C.
  I'm not anywhere *near* that level, so I just want to understand it on a theoretical level.
- That's about it for now, or at least as much as I'm 
  willing to share :)
