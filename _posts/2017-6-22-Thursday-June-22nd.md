## Values

## Why I'm doing this

- I attended an event tonight and I didn't enjoy it much. 
  I couldn't wait to leave, even though they were looking for 
  technical talent. It just wasn't a fit for me.
  
## I'm not going to bash the company on here

- It's probably a great company. Just not for me. 

## So...I'm making a list of my values

- This will serve as a dream list of values...
  things that mean a lot to me in my search
  
## Here goes

- Open Source commitment (the company is open to a community that
  is passionate about and endorses open-source)
  
- Peers : No one is better than another in terms of attitude.
  If they are (say, distinguished in the community), they're 
  open to sharing what they know if you're willing to learn
  
- Challenging

- Training or Self-Training culture (people want to be better)

- Keeps up with technology (nuff said)

- An Engineering Company. This is HUGE for me. I think I'd 
  best enjoy working for an engineering company. That is,
  the people who work in it are passionate about technology
  and making. They spend their spare time building RC planes
  hacking things together, making robots and lock-picking
  
- Innovation Encouraged (rewarded and encouraged). Go build something!

- Bonus **opportunity to learn functional programming**
  May have an internal meetup with Category Theory or something like that.
  
- Bonus **culture of playfulness and fun**. Witty and fun, 
  these people are both humble but incredibly smart, with an incredible wit.
  
## To be fair....

- This company (I've heard) **does** (or did) have a Category Theory group.
   Oh well..maybe there is someone perfect out there for them!
   
## And that's it...

- That's my bucket list! Hope you had fun reading it.
  As I think of more, I'll edit it or amend as need be.
  
- Maybe I'm being idealistic, but in my experience, when you write it down,
  that's a pretty good sign that you'll get it :)
