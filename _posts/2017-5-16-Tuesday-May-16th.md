## 5/16/17 - Shaders are Cool!


## Holy crap, Shaders are cool!!

Yes, I really did say that *twice* *twice*.

I had a *lot* of fun today on this stuff. 
I want to continue, and hopefully build a few games over the course of the rest of the year.
Specifically, in C++.

## Schedule

- I have class tonight (7 to 10pm).

- I get home around minutes to midnight.
  Then, I do laundry and pack.
  
- A shuttle picks me up at 3:45am or something,
  takes me to the airport, and my flight is at 7.
  
- Then I find the shuttle one stop away to take me to IO.
  Somewhere right after the Keynote, I'm supposed to make 
  my way to the CHM (Computer History Museum) to go see
  two friends. 
  
- Then I come back to IO, and then (possibly) head back again
  to CHM for a photo and hang-out with the ABI (Anita Borg Institute).
  
- Then I head back to IO for their Comedy show, ["Speechless"](https://www.google.com/events/io/schedule/session/ab1b1395-6fca-e311-b297-00155d5066d7) (around 6pm?).
 Speechless is an improv session, which is pretty much hilarious.
 It includes a random wheel in which contestants spin and therefore are given topics, and a 
 random set of presentation slides (which have nothing to do with each other).
 They must then give a presentation that is on-topic from the topic they received by spinning
 the wheel, while keeping a straight face and working with their (hilarious) slides given. 
 It's a lot of fun!

- Then, I take a shuttle back to SF and check-in. 

## Yep, it's a lot.

Feel free to look at some pretty renderings, though :)

## Changing the colour (inverting background and projected rectangle)

## Checking rotation 

![sh_016a](/images/sh_016a.png)

We rotated 45 degrees

## Implementing a light 

![sh_020](/images/sh_020.png)

This sort of blew my mind when it first compiled and ran

![sh_021](/images/sh_021.png)

## Some more 

![sh_022](/images/sh_022.png)

![sh_023](/images/sh_023.png)

## So these vertices are basically your "window" projection

![sh_024a](/images/sh_024a.png)

Only rendered  a rht (right angled-triangle)

- You're rendering vertex to vertex (see this [post](https://kammitama5.github.io/Monday-May-15th/))

![sh_024](/images/sh_024.png)

## Then we added a Mouse Pointer

- So it followed the Mouse around (it being the light position)

![sh_025](/images/sh_025.png)

## Duplicating renderings/ windows

## Merging windows

![sh_031](/images/sh_031.png)

## Tis no greater joy...

Than having the guy whose tut you're doing retweet you when 
flip out over his shader tut in C++. Hahaha.
So awesome!

## Conclusion

Man, I learned a *lot*, and this is fun! 
Definitely going to keep learning!
