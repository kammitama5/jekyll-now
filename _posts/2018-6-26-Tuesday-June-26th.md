## GSoC and RustReach Day 44

## It is actually 1 on Wednesday
- However, let's pretend it's Tuesday :D
- I set my alarm for 9:30pm, going to take a nap for 7:30pm, but I decided it would be more worthwhile to take a nap
  until 1 instead. This meant shuffling around my schedule, but thankfully, because of the holiday next week (for which
  I'll be paid yayee) it's possible. Once I get over the hump of today, my schedule is usually 5x as free (thankfully).
- It's the middle of the week (almost, it's Tuesday, remember :D) and if I don't take care of myself, things can go
  downhill *quickly*. And then I'll just be exhausted every day. And that's *not good*.
  
## So it looks like

- I should be able to spend Friday on Rust most of the day, with the evenings for Haskell, and same with Saturday.
  Sunday will be Haskell-day, as will be the 4th. Last year for July 4th, I was on a boat, but I really would *prefer*
  to be on my own and just getting work done.
  
## They've offered me more hours at my local internship

- We're working on this live project, but the pace isn't that fast, so I was able to do some work on ```records```,
  ```data```, ```type``` and ```newtype``` yesterday. Trying to understand that better. I also had my first real
  interaction with the ```ListMonad``` and ```Category```, and came across ```:!:```, which Gabe informed me I could
  look up on [Hayoo](https://hayoo.fh-wedel.de/). Yeah, I've never had to interact with Hayoo before, so we'll see
  how that goes.
  
## Some days
- Some days I get a lot more "noise" than others, in that it seems like a lot of people are contacting me. Today
  was such a day, which meant getting back to people (recruiters, etc). I've been finding my schedule Monday through
  Thursday (well, I usually finish work by 1pm on Thursdays) is get up at 4:40am, get to work by 6:30am, catch
  the 3:51pm bus and sometimes have a meeting (ie Mon/Wed) at 7pm (getting home by around 6pm), and then working 
  after that. So it can be a nasty turn-around depending. I've been finding myself napping on the way to work, 
  but practically snoring on the way back home. Those naps are super worth it, though, so I'm ready to do a meeting
  by the time I get home.
  
## The sailing is super important
- Because it's a respite from spending all my time in front of a computer. And it's physical. So good on me for doing
  that, even though I really just did it because I like sailing (particularly racing).
  
## Anyways
- I think that's about it for now. This week is pretty hectic for me, so trying to keep the pace with Haskell and devote
  my free day to Rust, while just getting work done in both areas. Get that hustle on. :D
