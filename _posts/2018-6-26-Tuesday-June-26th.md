## GSoC and RustReach Day 44

## It is actually 1 on Wednesday
- However, let's pretend it's Tuesday :D
- I set my alarm for 9:30pm, going to take a nap for 7:30pm, but I decided it would be more worthwhile to take a nap
  until 1 instead. This meant shuffling around my schedule, but thankfully, because of the holiday next week (for which
  I'll be paid yayee) it's possible. Once I get over the hump of today, my schedule is usually 5x as free (thankfully).
- It's the middle of the week (almost, it's Tuesday, remember :D) and if I don't take care of myself, things can go
  downhill *quickly*. And then I'll just be exhausted every day. And that's *not good*.
  
## So it looks like

- I should be able to spend Friday on Rust most of the day, with the evenings for Haskell, and same with Saturday.
  Sunday will be Haskell-day, as will be the 4th. Last year for July 4th, I was on a boat, but I really would *prefer*
  to be on my own and just getting work done.
  
## They've offered me more hours at my local internship

- We're working on this live project, but the pace isn't that fast, so I was able to do some work on ```records```,
  ```data```, ```type``` and ```newtype``` yesterday. Trying to understand that better. I also had my first real
  interaction with the ```ListMonad``` and ```Category```, and came across ```:!:```, which Gabe informed me I could
  look up on [Hayoo](https://hayoo.fh-wedel.de/). Yeah, I've never had to interact with Hayoo before, so we'll see
  how that goes.
