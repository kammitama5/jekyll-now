## GSoC and RustReach Day 17

## Had a Meeting with my GSoC mentors
- I'm wrapping up the Constructors (my last one type-checked, but they need to review it) and
  heading into some JavaScript. Specifically some front-end, and some Haskell that will generate
  HTML. I'm excited to learn that one, but it's overwhelming.
- They were saying that since I'm becoming comfortable with the process thus far, it's a good time to
  jump into the next part. It's overwhelming but I have 100% trust in both of them. They've really helped 
  me so much!
 
## Today at my PT
- Some of us were talking and one guy was saying he took the gig because he couldn't find anything else,
  and that it's a start into tech for him. And he mentioned "until you get to that 100K job".
  I thought about it and honestly, I'd really, really be happy with a Haskell job. That's all I want.
  My plan is to keep trying to do Haskell stuff until I'm good enough to be hired. I can't say I can think
  of anything else off the top of my head that would make me happier. I've really really enjoyed learning and 
  working in Haskell. I rush home to work on Haskell. I think about it all day at work.
  
## In the mornings, though..I do Rust :D
- I'm on chapter 12! Hey hey! It's fun, and I feel like I have a much better handle on things. The errors make 
  a lot more sense. I'm excited for our next meeting.
  
## Tomorrow
- I'm giving a tech talk! :D I'm excited about that, too.

## I could not have imagined
- About a month and a half ago, I was filled with anxiety and trepidation. Right now, I feel like I'm in great hands,
  and I'm really grateful for the opportunity. But with each month (as we're almost in June), I feel a bit bittersweet
  about the fact that it's one month closer to the end. I've been enjoying this so much. I could not have asked for a better
  summer, and it hasn't even begun yet!
