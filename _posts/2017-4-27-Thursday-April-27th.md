## 4/27/17 - Beer Masters

## Kata solved:

- Greeting with name, time (in Python)

```
def greetings(time, name):
    if (time == None) or (name == None):
        return "Hey dude greet someone"
    else:
        return "Good {} {}".format(time, name)
```

## Working on 

- Programming for Correctness 

## Later

- I attend the JPL German Club once a month. It's really fun! It's tonight, so looking forward to it.
