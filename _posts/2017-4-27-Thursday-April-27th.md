- I attend the JPL German Club once a month. It's really fun! It's tonight, so looking forward to it.

- I learned how to insert a therefore in LaTeX :) 
  I enjoy hanging out with my mentor because he also deeply appreciates (and has been using for many years)
  LaTeX. I really enjoy using it and hope to get better at it and use it professionally as long as I can
  (or even just for fun).
