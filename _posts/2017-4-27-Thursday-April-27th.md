## Kata solved:

- Greeting with name, time (in Python)

```
def greetings(time, name):
    // if either time or name is None, returns statement
    if (time == None) or (name == None):
        return "Hey dude greet someone"
    else:
        // returns "Good" + time + name
        return "Good {} {}".format(time, name) 
        //why am I writing JavaScript comments in Python? :)
        
```

## When the Struggle is Real

- I couldn't find this symbol.
  The guy teaching refers to it as "Expression"
  but I couldn't find it on Math Stack Exchange or in LaTeX documentation.
  So I tweeted and asked my Computational Mathematics friend about it. We'll see.

## Random

- I attend the JPL German Club once a month. It's really fun! It's tonight, so looking forward to it.

- I learned how to insert a therefore in LaTeX :) 
  I enjoy hanging out with my mentor because he also deeply appreciates (and has been using for many years)
  LaTeX. I really enjoy using it and hope to get better at it and use it professionally as long as I can
  (or even just for fun).
