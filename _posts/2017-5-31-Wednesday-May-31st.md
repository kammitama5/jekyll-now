## LambdaConf-itis :(

## I'm back home...

- I'm missing the Functional Programming community. 
  Hopefully, at least my Rust group and Haskell group
  will have a meetup soon.
  
  
- In any case, I have a workshop for four Saturdays starting.
  We have to add a feature to a Matchmaking App.
  Mine basically will allow you to narrow your choices
  based on whether you'd like a "hook-up" or
  a long-term relationship. 
  A person in that scenario doesn't care about information
  too far away, so better to exclude it, and it's helpful
  to have matches based on location (zip code, 
  or a "know your location" detection system etc).
  
## Here is the flow-chart for it.

## Other

- Working on finishing up a C++ lab. 
  It compiles, but the functions aren't
  testing properly. 
  
- Also, writing up notes for a quiz 
  next week Tuesday (in C++). 
  Should be a short one.
  
- Also need to start reviewing notes for
  final exam, too. I need to continue
  with the game engine, and the 
  LaTeX/Matlab. Hopefully I can continue
  once my exam is done (on the 13th).
  
- There was another workshop for five 
  Saturdays that I really wanted to do,
  but I can't afford it right now. 
  Basically, I've asked to audit. 
  If not, there is next time.
  I'd seriously attend all the workshops
  if I can audit, though!
  
## Of note 

- I learned a bit about [Hadamard Matrices](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HadamardMatrix.html) today. Really fascinating!

- Used by our very own JPL for Mariner and Voyager. Incredible!
