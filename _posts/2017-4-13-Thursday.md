## Today I learned:

- Starting to get a bit of intuition for Grothendieck (usually denoted by Tau). I particularly like this quote by Taylor Dupuy's Math Vlog:

*"if you have a covering and you cover the covering, (that) the covers of the covering give you a covering" :)*


- However, Zariski sites are a bit of a mystery. I'm learning

=================================================

## Things to get done:

- See if prof opens up quiz so I can take it. C++, that is. 

- Continue with Matlab, programming for correctness. I'm already starting to see that it is positively affecting my
ability to fluently read mathematical notation, which is fantastic.

- Continue with Lab for C++ (ie Lab #3, due on the 18th)


## Other notes: 

- Today I meet up with my Mathematician/ numerical computation friend. He usually helps with my understanding, so it's good to come to him with questions.

- This is an interesting book to look at -> Zariski Geometries: Geometry from the Logician's Point of View (Boris Zilber).

- Also, Saturated Model Theory -> by Gerald E. Sacks, which talks about "Saturated Bubbles" in Model Theory/ MT in general
