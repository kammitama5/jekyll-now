## GSoC and RustReach Day 25, \x -> x + 1

## Today was brutal
- I was tired as heck this morning, but my workmates actually decided to do a coffee break,
  so we got coffee and fraps downstairs! The sugar helped me stay awake, and I actually
  completed my sprint two hours before the end of the day, so I spent the rest of the afternoon
  learning PHP on my own.
  
- I was supposed to hang out with some JPL-ers, but I am much too tired. I'm planning to take a nap,
  get up and work on some Rust until the early morning, and come home tomorrow and work on Haskell
  during the weekend. 
- Saturday is JPL's open house, so I'll head over there early, and then spend the rest of the day doing
  Rust and Haskell (PM Rust and all day Sunday Haskell).
- I also have an exam on Monday. 

## I'm still heartbroken
- It's been rough. The next few days after LambdaConf always feel that way. I heard my friend missed his
  flight because he was so tired after LambdaConf; it takes a lot out of you because you give your all,
  because it's *your* community. These people are from all over the world and you may not see some of them
  until next year, at least.
  
## In the afternoon
- A little birdie (with big puffy hair) sent me this photo. It really made me smile!
