## JPL Open House

## Made it!

- So I got up at 4, running on twelve hours of sleep
  in four days. Took two buses, and when I got to my
  third connection, I realized after 30 minutes nothing
  was showing up.
  So I walked for four miles (two to and two back).
  Apparently, there *was* a bus, but there was some kind
  of cycling thing in the morning so no buses on my journey
  to JPL. I could have taken one back, but walking back was ok.
  I had a sno-cone so it was all good. 
  Made my other connections, and back home.
  
## I also had my first funnel cake!

## The Experience

- Going to JPL is always great, but I also wanted to get a sense of some
  stuff this time, because I plan to intern there within the next year or so. 
  I didn't come *just* to be a fanboy (or fangirl). 
  I got some great advice, and people there have been going through a similar
  situation. 
  Basically, the tech community is limited, and right now, *everyone* needs engineers...*badly*.
  I'm not talking about the cliche of "I work in tech", but I mean the people who get their 
  hands dirty. There just isn't enough of them to go around. 
  
  So people are getting poached like crazy. Basically, if you as a budding (or in your
  career) just focus on being *good*, you'll have no problem at all. If you're good,
  you really have your pick. This is a question that I don't worry *too* much about,
  but comes back into my mind again and again. 
  I've only just started, but the consensus thus far seems to be that people see me 
  as intelligent/ competent, and so I'been getting good feedback. So then
  the problem becomes "am I sure I'm making the right choice?" going in one direction
  vs another. 
  
  For a certain tier, it isn't about the money. A lot of these people are the people who 
  would be doing what they do even if they weren't getting paid, and they are *good*. 
  So then it becomes about working on interesting projects. For me, it's not so much
  the company (even though I'm not worried, based on what I've seen thus far), but 
  I just want to be good, and I've seen how a positive (or negative) environment can
  affect this. Also, safe choices can be a detriment later on. Better to be picky
  and have a colorful career than to be safe.
  
## Anyways...

- Here are some pics

## Backstory
- I went to the Darpa Robotics Challenge as an attendee a few years ago.
  Fell in love with Robo-simian. Also, one of my professors worked on him. 
  This professor is also working on the Mars 2020 Rover, and gave me my first
  recommendation, that got me into a JPL workshop, which is where my adventures
  with JPL began. And so I continue, hopefully next year with some sort of internship.
  In the meantime, I've met a lot of great scientists and engineers with whom I keep into
  contact, and with whom I sometimes go drinking haha. 
  I also have a mentor with whom I hang out on Thursdays (typically). We talk about 
  Mathematics and Computers, pretty much haha.

## This one
- I saw a video on this guy. Basically they used the gecko and created a robot
  and using biomimicry and the concept of Van Der Waals forces, created this 
  gripping device. So the hooks help the robot to climb

## Pickering

- At JPL, most of the buildings are named by letters.
  So when you work there, people usually ask "Where do you work?" 
  and you'd say something like "261" or whatever.
  A mathematician friend of mine once joked that he was trying to figure
  out what algorithm he could use to figure out in what order the buildings
  were designated. It was only afterwards he figured out each building was 
  numbered in the order in which they received funding to be built LOL.
  
- But Pickering is one of (two?) to have an actual building named after him.
  His contribution is *significant*, and you can easily read about him.
  So one of the auditoriums is named after him (another is Von Karman).

## Asteroids

[jpl_010](/images/jpl_010.png)

- How do you figure out if Asteriods will collide into Earth and destroy it? 
  Oh, I totally learned today that Uranus's moons rotate 90 degrees to the Sun,
  possibly because of some collison in the past. So the mission to Uranus is 
  often quite challenging.

## Radioisotopes

- One of the first things they taught us in the workshops was about JPL's use 
  of radioisotopes. These contain Plutonium 238, which has a half-life of about 88 years.
  Today, I got to hold the plutonium, and talk to a scientist at length about cryobots 
  that would melt ice in front of the robot, while the ice behind it stayed frozen,
  using radioisotopes. Really fascinating stuff.

## Starshades

- These block light. I really like this design. I thought it was a radial solar array at first. Welp.
  I asked about polarizers, and they said polarization is expensive. Oh, I also learned about Captron,
  which is like Mylar, but is the material used for the starshades.

## A few years ago

- I was really into LEDs. So I buried myself in learning about MEMS, substrates, gallium arsenide
  and silicon carbide, epitaxies and etching wafers, etc. So it was really trippy to go by this room
  today. It's a clean-room. I was able to talk at length with the scientist about how it compared to
  my visiting Intel and their clean-room, which has wafers carried by a railing system above what humans
  can touch. Humans, are of course, the biggest contributor of "unclean" to your clean room,
  because of their constant skin particles going everywhere yuck. I think he was talking about down to
  14 nanometres for the etching. Again..really interesting stuff!
  
## Measuring Seismic Activity

- This is Insight, which measures Seismic activity

[jpl_018](/images/jpl_018.png)

- I should have done a better image with this, but I was too busy chatting away.
  The guy said at the end that they'd love to have me, if it all works out. We shall see.
  But you can see the radial solar array here. 
  
## Tensegrity (one of my favourites)

- This is a neat puzzle/invention. It is compact but also rigid. 
  Basically, it's about four rigid pieces, and the others are elastic.
  So it's both flexible and rigid. Really great engineering.
