## JPL Open House

## Made it!

- So I got up at 4, running on twelve hours of sleep
  in four days. Took two buses, and when I got to my
  third connection, I realized after 30 minutes nothing
  was showing up.
  So I walked for four miles (two to and two back).
  Apparently, there *was* a bus, but there was some kind
  of cycling thing in the morning so no buses on my journey
  to JPL. I could have taken one back, but walking back was ok.
  I had a sno-cone so it was all good. 
  Made my other connections, and back home.
