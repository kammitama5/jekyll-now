- She's my roommate for the next three days!
  Yes, she is *really* that adorable! :D
  
## Maths

- I finished up a chapter on SQL and have to do a project
  doing data analysis on some weather information. I'll
  complete that this week.
- I've done some SQL in the past, but it's really the 
  perfect way to begin a Data Science course. It's perfect
  that they began it in this way, with some Excel thrown in.
  After I complete that, we move into Python and Pandas, etc
  
- I was also able to complete the first week of a Data Science
  Maths course. I just decided to do it to refresh some of my 
  stats knowledge.
  
- Lo and behold, it fit in perfectly with an excuse to write 
  LaTeX!

## Upcoming

- Finish project using SQL and Excel

## One more thing

- I got Haskell book! I probably won't begin until the 
  New Year, though; I have my hands full right now.
  
- I'm up to 20 students in terms of mentorship, also.

- And...that's about it!
