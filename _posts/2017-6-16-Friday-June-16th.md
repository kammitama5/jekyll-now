## Nanodegree Scholarship from Udacity!

- Came home from our first Mathematics for CS Meetup.
  It was great meeting everyone.
  
- One the way home, got a text from a classmate 
  about a beer pong CS party tomorrow evening hahaha.
  That depends on how I feel after tomorrow's session from 9 to 6pm.
  
- I also have some corrections to make for my Coding for Product Workshop.
  Hopefully can get that work done, along with some of the workshop work
  tomorrow during the day.
  
## Got home and saw this in my inbox!

- So amazing! I'm so so thankful to be a part of the 
  Tech community. It's been amazing how wonderful 
  they've been to me, and I'm just really happy
  to be a part of it! 
  
## Kata 

- filter out vowels from array 

## Solution

```
function vowelFilter (letters) {
  var vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];
  var arr = [];
 for (var i = 0; i < letters.length; i++)
 {
   if ((letters[i] != "i") && 
   (letters[i] != "a") &&
   (letters[i] != "e") && 
   (letters[i] != "o") &&
   (letters[i] != "u"))
   {
     arr.push(letters[i])
   }
  
 }
 
  return arr;
};
```
