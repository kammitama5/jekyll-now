## 5/4/17 - Cassini and May the 4th...be with you.

## Agenda

- I'm at home today, so working through my logic course.

- Tonight, I'm going to see a lecture on Cassini at JPL. 

- This weekend, I hope to get my C++ work done

We used this correctness approach to find the solution bit by bit of a function in Matlab,
that evaluates Polynomials. I want to go over this chapter on my own again, if I have time.

## Other

This is from the talk tonight. It was the Cassini mission, and it was awesome!
This is actually Juno Spacecraft (a model), to 1/5 scale.

I watched a really interesting lecture on Asteroid Mining last night.

Sorry if it sounds like I'm pimping this place in every post, but I really *love* this place!
