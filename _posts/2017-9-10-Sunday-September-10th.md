## Back from Catalina and good news!

## Good news first...

- I just got back in to find that I've been accepted to LinkedIn's recruitment
  for students who are about to look for work. I was invited to apply by two 
  of LinkedIn's recruiters. So excited for the event! :)

## I got back in from Catalina. 

- It was my first time sailing over, and my first time there.

- We left at noon on Friday, and got back by 5pm on Sunday. 

## Here are some pics!


## Water is a huge problem on the island...

- You put in two dollars in quarters for three minutes and 20 seconds of water
  for a shower. I actually thought it was about 5 minutes..way more than I needed!

## Saturday view 

- We took a dinghy over to the camp ground and had a BBQ with some people from other
  marinas. Also, the night before, there was a dinghy roundup where we passed around food!

- return Two's complement 
  ie. switch ones with zeros

```
function onesComplement(n) {
    var arr = []
    for (var i = 0; i < n.length; i++){
      if (n[i] == '1'){
        arr.push('0')
      }
      else if (n[i] == '0'){
        arr.push('1')
      }
    }
    g = arr.join('')
    
    return g
};
```
- Find the value where 3^k < N, given N 

```
# there is nothing to explain
# this is english -> mathematics
def largestPower(N):
  import math
  num = 0
  while (math.pow(3, num) < N):
    num = num + 1 
  return num - 1
```

- multiply values in string and return the answer as a string

```
function arrMultiply(arr){
   var total = 1
   for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
   // set total to 0 if any value is 0
     if (arr[i] == '0'){
     total = 0
     }
     else
     {
      total = total * parseInt(arr[i])
    }
   }
   return(total.toString())
}
```

- Insert a dash between any two odd numbers.

```
function insertDash(num) {
   var arr = []
   var a = num.toString()
   
   // check for both 
   for (var i = 0; i < a.length; i++){
     if ((a[i] % 2 !== 0) && (a[i+1] % 2 !== 0))
      arr.push(a[i]+'-')
     else{
       arr.push(a[i])
     }
   }
   var b = arr.join('')
   
   // strip off any dashes at end
   if (b[b.length-1] == '-')
    return(b.slice(0,b.length-1))
   else{
     return(b)
   }
}
```
