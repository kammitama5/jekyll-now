## Back from Catalina and good news!

## Good news first...

- I just got back in to find that I've been accepted to LinkedIn's recruitment
  for students who are about to look for work. I was invited to apply by two 
  of LinkedIn's recruiters. So excited for the event! :)

## I got back in from Catalina. 

- It was my first time sailing over, and my first time there.

- We left at noon on Friday, and got back by 5pm on Sunday. 

## Here are some pics!


## Water is a huge problem on the island...

- You put in two dollars in quarters for three minutes and 20 seconds of water
  for a shower. I actually thought it was about 5 minutes..way more than I needed!

## Saturday view 

- We took a dinghy over to the camp ground and had a BBQ with some people from other
  marinas. Also, the night before, there was a dinghy roundup where we passed around food!
