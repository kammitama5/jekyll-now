## SCNA re-cap and following week

## Friday/ Saturday = SCNA

- So SCNA is the Software Craftsmanship of North America conference
- It was originally held in Chicago, but for the past two years (now in its 9th year)
  it has been held in LA.
  
## Friday

- Friday was a series of presentations from various speakers

## Saturday was a day of code (optional)

## Upcoming

- Finished a coding quiz. I didn't do at all as well as I would have liked,
  but it was my first timed quiz, so I can only get better from there, 
  knowing what to expect.
