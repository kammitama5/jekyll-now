## SCNA re-cap and following week

## Friday/ Saturday = SCNA

- So SCNA is the Software Craftsmanship of North America conference
- It was originally held in Chicago, but for the past two years (now in its 9th year)
  it has been held in LA.
  
## Friday

- Friday was a series of presentations from various speakers


## Software Jeopardy

- During lunch and before the afternoon session,
  we had some Software Jeopardy with a panel. 
  They panelists all did really well. Some of those
  questions were tough, but I got some of the Haskell stuff!

## Saturday was a day of code (optional)

- We did pair programming first.
  I paired with two people; the first of whom 
  was familiar with Ruby. The goal was to solve
  Conway's Game of Life.
- We decided to start with the definition of a Board first

- My second partner uses C#, so we got set up 
  on his laptop. I actually liked his set-up a lot.
  He uses a Mouse, like I do. His IDE also helped
  us a lot, and even was able to set up unit tests. 
  
- He wanted to start with a more object-oriented approach,
  by defining tests like checking if a cell has neighbours,
  and then checking if those cells have neighbours, etc
  
## After lunch (Saturday)

- We did mob programming with Woody. 
- We used Java to first start writing unit tests. 
  The first was to not use anything but primitives. 
  People then focused on state.
- In the second round, we started over and used a 
  constraint of only functions allowed.

- After that, we used Mocha and Chai to use Node/JS
  and write unit tests. 
- One guy who loves Java said "I'm just going to keep
  writing Java until the IDE complains". That was funny!
  It was nice to see people out of their element.

## Upcoming

- Finished a coding quiz. I didn't do at all as well as I would have liked,
  but it was my first timed quiz, so I can only get better from there, 
  knowing what to expect. 
  
- Finishing up Homework 4 in C++

- Getting my Markdown file completed today and finishing up 
  Python code to wrap up Nanodegree. My Postgres works,
  so all is good on that front. We'll see how it works
  with my code (hopefully tonight)
