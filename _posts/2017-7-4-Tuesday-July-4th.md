## Happy 4th! With Mock-Ups and Sailing...

## I stayed up last night...

- I stayed up to complete the lesson for Project 2 of the Nanodegree, 
  so I could focus on the actual Project for the next 10 days.
  
- Since that is done, I thought I should look at some possible topics
  and designs, as we can make our web page about pretty much anything.
  
- That being said, there *is* a rubric to follow.
  It basically must use:
  * three style rules in CSS
  * one class selector rule 
  * at least one image
  * 2 sections of content
  
## What am I interested in?

- I decided to make mine a small webpage on the Foundations of 
  Functional programming. Most of the content, though 
  interesting to me, is on some horrible webpage that 
  is just being passed around, so maybe if mine looks 
  a bit more approachable, more people would like to 
  try out functional programming. :)
  
- So how about if I made mine pretty?

## That's a huge project, isn't it?

- Nope. Mine is just blurbs, touching on some topics. 
  They can seek out references if they want more information.
  
## Things I wanted to cover 

- I drew out a list of things and came out with about 12 to 14 elements.
  * Navbar/ Header
  * Profile with photo of Alonzo Church
  * Small bio
  * Category Theory header (column info)
  * Lambda Calculus header (column info)
  * Column Info detail (Category Theory)
  * Column Info detail (Lambda Calculus)
  * Curry-Howard Isomorphism header
  * Maybe an image of some LaTeX (optional)
  * Footnotes/ References header 
  * Footnotes detail to href links
  * Share this via fb or twitter (optional)
  
 ## Then...
 
 - Moved on to some mock-ups. I think I like 
   the second one, even though the margins aren't equal

 ## Continuing...
 
 - So this should give me enough time to work on implementing these
   and getting feedback, etc.
   
 - I don't expect to get it right the first time, but the 
   feedback so far from the programme has been very good
   in terms of the usefulness to me.
 
 ## Oh...If I get cool Sailing pics...
 
 - I will also try to get cool sailing pics...we'll see.
   I'm in love with sailing. I hope that one day I can just 
   do it on my own.
