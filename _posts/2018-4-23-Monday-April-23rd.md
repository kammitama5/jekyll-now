## Google Summer of Code: The Beginning

## Today I was surprised with the craziest news ever...

<img src="/images/GSoc_/g_001.png" width="500">

- I got into Google Summer of Code! No way!
- I was literally in the middle of a BigN online interview, and I think I was bombing hard haha.
- But like all things, I treat it as an opportunity to learn and get better.

## What I'm most excited about

- Having recently been laid off from a gig, I'm excited to just focus 100% on learning Haskell and working with Gabe and Chris,
  my two mentors. 
- I'm excited about continuing to learn Haskell. I really couldn't be happier!
- Haskell all the things!

## I actually
- I have an onsite on Thursday that's going to be in C++, so I'm going to study for that right now. I'm going to do that
  today and tomorrow, be done by Thurs, and get back into Haskell. 
- Strangely, Haskell has made my problem-solving skills a lot better. It's the language I enjoy the most and the one
  I intend to stick with.
- I can't believe I ALMOST DIDN'T APPLY. A dear friend of mine, who works in Haskell, asked me to do so. I didn't think
  I had the ability. But I have a real, continued desire to learn Haskell. I also have a real desire to be mentored
  by my mentors; I think that I can learn a lot from them.
- Haskell really changed my life for the better; I LOVE the community. My proposal had a bit of that; a bit of everything
  that I learned and a bit of the community that means so much to me.
  
## Oh yeah...
- BayHac is coming up. I'm excited about that, too. Both my mentors will be there. My friends will be there. And there'll
  be lots of Haskell, so I have nothing to complain about :D
  
## And that's about it!
