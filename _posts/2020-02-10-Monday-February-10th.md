## My first AAAI

## How do you know that you belong in a place?
- I was thinking about the answer to this question today, as I was grading the last of homework before heading to sleep, at 3 am.
- I attended my first AAAI conference this weekend. Alas, I have class, and I don't intend to miss any this semester, so I
  could only stay for two days, but it was really worth it for me.
  
## I ended up here by accident
- I was asked if I would be interested in hosting a lunch, in exchange for a ticket and my hotel/flight covered.
  I thought that that sounded great, so over the past few weeks, I was part of a group that organized a lunch, gave out 
  travel grants that included admission to AAAI, flights and hotel covered. It was a great experience for me, because 
  everyone was so on top of everything, and it was a way I felt that I could give back.
  
## Apparently, I was trolled
- It was only until I got to the conference that I noticed that my name was on the programme as the organizer; as uhh *the* organizer.
  The organization (Black in AI) that planned the lunch decided to let me set up the lunch, and to give me the opportunity to shine
  as an organizer. I thought that that was one of the most thoughtful things anyone has done for me in a while. It's an indirect way of saying that they knew that I had the capability to do it, and that they believed in me.
  And I really appreciated it. Essentially, what the organization lead was hinting was that I should step up as a leader
  and do my stuff, and I really was thankful for the opportunity. It gave me visibility in a group I already had a lot of
  respect for, and allowed me to interact with several high-profile persons in tech and academia in a meaningful way. All in the first
  year of my PhD. That's really something special, particularly at such a large conference.

## I volunteered on a panel also
- I volunteered to be on a panel for Try AI, in which we spoke with students from CUNY (City University in New York). It was
  awesome. Liz (a grad student at Harvard) put the event on and it was a memorable experience for me getting to see high schoolers passionate about the 
  future of AI. I'm thankful for that opportunity.

- They are amazing and have such a bright future! I would definitely participate again next year!

- I LOVE THEM all! Thank you for being a part of my life during my PhD. Such a supportive group!

## Imposter Syndrome
- AAAI is a conference with everyone in the AI field you can ever imagine. It's very technical, and while he was speaking,
  I couldn't help but note the difference between Geoff Hinton's talk at Google I/O (geared more towards developers) vs
  his talk here. It was like night vs day. 
  
- Dr. Jasmine Jones spoke about Imposter syndrome today at the Black in AI lunch (we were grateful to have some incredibly high profile persons attend our lunch!), and about the importance of participating, not being afraid to
 ask questions and to step up in a space in which you are underrepresented. This was especially meaningful for me, as 
 at these types of conferences, without a support group, it's easy to feel like you don't belong. Everyone is from a top
 school, everyone is doing research with crazy sponsorships from ten companies, everyone doesn't really look like you or have your perspective. So that's important
 to remember; you bring your journey and your perspective with you, and that it's important, and it's very valuable. You belong here.
 
## Three Turing award winners
- Spoke at the event today. Hinton, LeCun and Bengio. I thought it interesting that they mostly were doing research
  that everyone else was not particularly interested in. But the idea ended up influencing ML and AI and a whole different
  perspective. So that takeaway was to not be afraid to do what other people aren't doing; be curious enough to take the chance to do something completely different.
  
## The location for the Black in AI lunch

- They (Papillon Bistro) were really professional, and very prompt and helpful and it was just a great experience working with them!

- I have not seen this guy in more than a decade! We were in choir together in high school in Trinidad! Amazingness!
  Was fun catching up! Totally unexpected!

## Fellows Talk
- The three Turing award winners spoke; Hinton, Bengio and LeCun. Each for 20 minutes about what they're currently working on

## I left super grateful

- I left the event right after the Fellows talk to catch my flight back to Vermont. I left feeling super grateful for everything, and feeling so supported by the entire AI community. It wasn't my intention to become a part of it, but it's my intention to stay. 

## And that's it

## Update
- AAAI has been thoughtful and generous enough to send all Chairs and Committee members Certificates of Appreciation!
  Truly thankful for this!
