## A solution:

_Determine whether +*a-b/c++de-fg is a pre-fix expression._

- If you are unfamiliar with
  pre-and post expressions, there's this thing called ["Reverse Polish notation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).
  
  This is for a C++ class, but having done some functional programming,
  the first thing I thought of was a Lisp or Racket-esque approach.
  
  So...I used Clojure and evaluated it as a pre-fix expression.

  You should definitely give Clojure, Racket, Lisp, Haskell, Rust, a try. 
  
- I'm a part of the Clojure (and Haskell, and Rust) community, 
  having received a scholarship to attend my first Clojure Conj last year in Austin, Texas,
  a city I'd never been to before.
  
- I also met one of my mentors from Red Hat, Toby, who is a hoot! 
  And, I was also able to attend Clojure West in Portland, Oregon, this year.
