## 4/21/17 - Different Languages

## A solution:

_Determine whether +*a-b/c++de-fg is a pre-fix expression._

- If you are unfamiliar with
  pre-and post expressions, there's this thing called ["Reverse Polish notation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).
  
  This is for a C++ class, but having done some functional programming,
  the first thing I thought of was a Lisp or Racket-esque approach.
  
- So...I used Clojure and evaluated it as a pre-fix expression.
  I actually first used a, b...g and separated them via parentheses. 
  
- When I was sure it was a legitimate expression in Clojure,
  I evaluated the value using actual numbers.

  You should definitely give [Clojure](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/clojure/), [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/), [Lisp](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/lisp/), [Haskell](https://www.tryhaskell.org/), [Rust](http://rustbyexample.com/index.html), a try. 
  
- I'm a part of the Clojure (and Haskell, and Rust) community, 
  having received a scholarship to attend my first Clojure Conj last year in Austin, Texas,
  a city I'd never been to before.
  
- I also met one of my mentors from Red Hat, Toby, who is a hoot! 
  And, I was also able to attend Clojure West in Portland, Oregon, this year.

 ## Speaking of functional...
 
 - I found UPenn's Online Haskell course. They use Pictures! 
   If I have time next week (after I get my midterm done,
   since that's going to be a week of no C++ homework for me)
   I can breeze through the Haskell course for fun :)
   If that's impossibe, I'll just save the notes
   and do it another time.

  ## Things I think about 
  
- I have a mentor from JPL/NASA who I meet with every Thursday.
  One of the things we spoke about was thinking before coding.
  
- It's something I think about a lot. Some of the best programmers I've met
  _think_ before they code, they don't just tap-tap away.
  
- I think that tools like LaTeX, learning C++, Rust, Haskell
  have a sort of structure that emphasize or encourage 
  _thinking_ before coding, which is why I'm sticking with them.
  
## Kata Solved 

Create a function that returns 2x its value unless it's tricky.
Tricky = double number eg. 44, 4343, 77, 2525 etc. 

```
function trickyDoubles(n){
      var a = n.toString()  fomd 
      var len = (a.length / 2); // find first half
      var len1 = a.length; // find second half
      
      var x = a.slice(0, len)
      //console.log(x) I was checking value 
      var y = a.slice(len, len1)
      //console.log(y) I was checking value
      
      
      if (x == y){
        return (n)
      }
      else{
       return (n * 2)
      }
     
      return
}

```


  
## I'd like to attend -> Bucket-list
 
 [CodeMesh.io](http://www.codemesh.io/)
- My people! :)
  My brother lives in the UK, so this isn't _impossible_.
  Hey, maybe we can do a two-for-one, since because of me he's learning some Rust (mwahaha).
  
## Other -> things to learn

- [YORP effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarkovsky%E2%80%93O%27Keefe%E2%80%93Radzievskii%E2%80%93Paddack_effect) (watching too much Scott Manley)
- Clearer understanding of a [_monomorphism_](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monomorphism)
- [Haskell Wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Monomorphism) has an _excellent_ explanation that is a great starting point.
