## 4/21/17 - Different Languages

## A solution:

_Determine whether +*a-b/c++de-fg is a pre-fix expression._

- If you are unfamiliar with
  pre-and post expressions, there's this thing called ["Reverse Polish notation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).
  
  This is for a C++ class, but having done some functional programming,
  the first thing I thought of was a Lisp or Racket-esque approach.
  
- So...I used Clojure and evaluated it as a pre-fix expression.
  I actually first used a, b...g and separated them via parentheses. 
  
- When I was sure it was a legitimate expression in Clojure,
  I evaluated the value using actual numbers.

  You should definitely give [Clojure](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/clojure/), [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/), [Lisp](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/lisp/), [Haskell](https://www.tryhaskell.org/), [Rust](http://rustbyexample.com/index.html), a try. 
  
- I'm a part of the Clojure (and Haskell, and Rust) community, 
  having received a scholarship to attend my first Clojure Conj last year in Austin, Texas,
  a city I'd never been to before.
  
- I also met one of my mentors from Red Hat, Toby, who is a hoot! 
  And, I was also able to attend Clojure West in Portland, Oregon, this year.

  ## Things I think about 
  
- I have a mentor from JPL/NASA who I meet with every Thursday.
  One of the things we spoke about was thinking before coding.
  
- It's something I think about a lot. Some of the best programmers I've met
  _think_ before they code, they don't just tap-tap away.
  
- I think that tools like LaTeX, learning C++, Rust, Haskell
  have a sort of structure that emphasize or encourage 
  _thinking_ before coding, which is why I'm sticking with them.
