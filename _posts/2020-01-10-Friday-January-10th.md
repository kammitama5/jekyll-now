## RWC 2020

## I attended my first RWC conference! 

- It actually wasn't supposed to happen, but I really wanted to attend, and I emailed the organizers.
  They responded and surprisingly, offered me a very generous travel grant to attend! I overheard later on that
  if you are a PhD student, they try to support your attendance with a travel grant of some kind, but I'm not sure
  of the veracity of this. There is also student volunteering; I did see some volunteers who looked like they might be 
  students. 
- It was highly worth it! I left with a special place in my heart for this conference. I met a bunch of people from the 
  crypto research community. This was also by accident. When I arrived, I expected that I wouldn't really make friends, so I sat in the
  front row, close to the stage. A really nice lady sat next to me, and we immediately struck up a conversation. It was
  also chilly near the stage, and she offered me her scarf to stay warm. She introduced me to members of her team, and
  to my surprise, my advisor told me later on when I was relaying the story of this really nice lady who welcomed me 
  at this conference I was attending for the first time, that she worked in an amazingly awesome research group from a
  well-known company in industry. So that was unexpected, and it was pretty awesome that she and everyone I met was just
  so nice to me. 
- Surprisingly, I also met up with a friend I knew from my time in Los Angeles who was living in New York City, working
  as a security engineer. So I did end up knowing people there, and a bunch of us took the train home together each evening.
  The whole experience was just really excellent, and it felt like my people. I have all these new friends now, and I left
  feeling really great about everything, and about the conference. 
  
## In the evenings
- I would take the train to Brooklyn to get roti and doubles :) It was just a really great conference. It also motivated
  me to submit a talk, once I get into my topic, because they have a pretty approachable acceptance rate (about 37%). So 
  it's something to think about.
  
## The Levchin Prize
- Three persons got the prize this year! One of them was Ralph Merkle, the inventor of Merkle trees. We saw a photo of
  an undergraduate proposal he submitted, with the teacher's markings (I've included a photo in the photos below)
  
## Here are some photos of my favourite talks...and some NYC photos!

## Next year's conference will take place in Amsterdam
- Kind of a stretch, but maybe I'll get to attend again sometime. It was highly worth it for me.
