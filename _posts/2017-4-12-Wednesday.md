## 4/12/17

## Today I learned:

- Working on C++ lab -> Linked List implementation (not due until 4/ 18)

- Start Matlab/Programming for correctness 

- Do C++ quiz (due 4/ 16)

- Start viewing lectures on Grothendieck Topology for LambdaConf

Notes:
- I found this interesting book via nLab/nCatLab called "Sketches of an Elephant", by Peter Johnstone. Interested in that and Lyle Kopnicky's notes on Cat Theory for understanding.
