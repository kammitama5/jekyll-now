## Programming Languages and Concept Lattices


```
Nowadays, it seems more and more supporters are
being won by the view that arithmetic is a 
further development of logic;
that a more rigorous establishment of 
arithmetical laws reduces them to purely 
logical laws and to such laws alone..."
```
- from "Function and Concept by Gottlob Frege
- You can read his book, The Foundations of Arithmetic, [here](http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Frege,Gottlob/Frege,%20Gottlob%20-%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic%20(1953)%202Ed_%207.0-2.5%20LotB.pdf)

## Wait what?
- I stumbled upon this quote while reading about [Begriffs](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Begriff), 
which were referenced in my Formal Concepts Analysis coursework. I've been thinking about that a bit, since my path 
has been influenced by continued interest in mathematical logic and how it ties into computer science. 

- I'm specifically learning a bit about Concept Lattices, which are super amazing! There is even [software](https://github.com/fcatools/conexp-ng) that allows you to
  add and delete relationships and connect nodes and edges together in such lattices! Just wicked! :D

## Concept Lattice terms / things to think about
- [Infimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infimum_and_supremum)
- [Supremum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infimum_and_supremum)
- What constitutes a complete lattice? 
- Transitivity
- Irreducibility

## Don't you go to school?
- Yes! I had my first Programming Languages class and I *loved* it! Sure, this isn't Programming Language Theory, 
  which resembles more Discrete Mathematics, but it's about Programming Languages, and we get to make a compiler! 
  So I'm psyched. We actually spoke about Cobol, Algol, Lisp, JIT, etc. 
- It was really a bit sad because our class was half-full. It seems sort of like a metaphor; students (at least from 
  my school), if given the chance, may not necessarily care about languages other than the ones they have to learn. 
  I wish there were some way to encourage people to try out other languages! 
  
## Anyways
- I was supposed to hang out with my mentor tonight at JPL, but I was offered an opportunity to help out at a recruiting event.
  So I'm up for that. I'll get to meet a bunch of recruiters, get paid for my time and meet a bunch of programmers and even
  get fed. I mean..I see no downsides, and it's just for a couple hours. 
  
## And that's about it!
- Oh, I spoke about Matthias yesterday, and he popped up in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91hynuuM_As) via the ACM that includes Racket! My friend, Ben (from POPL)
  makes an appearance in his group of advisees in the video, too! :D
