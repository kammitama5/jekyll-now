## Plotting in Julia

## Spent today plotting in Julia

- Wrote a function and plotted X against Y

- Then plotted it. The grid on command apparently changed from 
  ```grid("on")``` to ```gr()```. Oh..kayyy.

## User Defined Types in Julia
- User defined types in Julia are just *awesome*.
  You can add constraints, and there are Any types,
  which are the subset of all types, and other types,
  such as Abstract, Concrete, and Composite. 
  I'm really enjoying it.
