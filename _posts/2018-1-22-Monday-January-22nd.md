## Plotting in Julia

## Spent today plotting in Julia

- Wrote a function and plotted X against Y

- Then plotted it. The grid on command apparently changed from 
  ```grid("on")``` to ```gr()```. Oh..kayyy.

## User Defined Types in Julia
- User defined types in Julia are just *awesome*.
  You can add constraints, and there are ```Any``` types,
  which are the subset of all types, and other types,
  such as ```Abstract```, ```Concrete```, and ```Composite```. 
  I'm really enjoying it. 
  
## Other
- I have a list of things to get together for my sailing trip next week
- I'm going to Sparklecon this weekend!
- I'm going to work through the final SQL section of my Udacity course,
  and finish up Project 1.
- I also need to get started on the coursework for week 3 Julia course.
  I'm going to get that certificate!
  
## And that's about it!
