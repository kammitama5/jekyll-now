## Plotting in Julia

## Spent today plotting in Julia

- Wrote a function and plotted X against Y

- Then plotted it. The grid on command apparently changed from 
  ```grid("on")``` to ```gr()```. Oh..kayyy. 
- Also, what's neat is that for the title, it truncates after any ```(```,
  but it *will*, if you type ```^```, raise that to the power, as you would like it
  to do, which is nice!

## User Defined Types in Julia
- User defined types in Julia are just *awesome*.
  You can add constraints, and there are ```Any``` types,
  which are the subset of all types, and other types,
  such as ```Abstract```, ```Concrete```, and ```Composite```. 
  I'm really enjoying it. 
  
## Other people
- plotted some interesting stuff like the [Legendre Polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials) or the [Lemniscate function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemniscate_of_Bernoulli). I didn't know about Lemniscate before, so taht was really interesting!
I think I may have made a moving sculpture via welding before that uses some version of the concept, though.
  
## Other
- I have a list of things to get together for my sailing trip next week
- I'm going to Sparklecon this weekend!
- I'm going to work through the final SQL section of my Udacity course,
  and finish up Project 1.
- I also need to get started on the coursework for week 3 Julia course.
  I'm going to get that certificate!
- I saw this ```boken``` function, but it looks like it may be [discontinued](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/Bokeh.jl)?
  In particular, [this](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/Bokeh.jl/issues/38) issue.
  
## And that's about it!
