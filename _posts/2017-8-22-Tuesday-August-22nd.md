## Mathematica and Python Nanodegree cont'd...

## Updates...
  
## Nanodegree

- We're doing fun stuff like this in Python!

## A movie site that shows images of movies you like, and gives descriptions

## Click on the image and it will play the trailer!

- Learning about classes and objects, and how to instantiate so that they call on different objects.

## Teaching myself Mathematica

- In the midst of my Nanodegree and before my C++ class continues,
  I thought that I should use a 15-day trial of Mathematica.
  
## Wait..*what* is Mathematica?

- It's a tool used for numerical computation, data visualization, primarily used by mathematicians, scientists and engineers.
  It is known for its precision and was invented by [Stephen Wolfram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram).
  
- Here is the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Mathematica)
  
## But why? 

- Here is a great article on who uses [Mathematica](http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/who-uses-mathematica.pdf).

- There is also quite an active [Mathematica Stack Exchange](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/). Do subscribe!

- It's always been something I've been interested in learning a bit of; I can't put my finger on why right now.

- That being said, I did finish a project early, and I only have a 15-day trial, so I thought that this would be perfect timing.

## So...
  
- My beginnings were from this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dha9O1XN_f0&feature=em-share_video_in_list_user&list=PLdr5XE6u9kEpS95yKoZwl6kidiFaLnU5s)
  
- I liked it so much, I bought a book on it, and plan on continuing, taking
  baby steps to learn.
  
## It's like Matlab, LaTeX and Jupyter had a baby!

- Seriously, if you're familiar with those, things will seem *very* familiar! 
  It's super fun!
  

- I'm still learning, but here's some of what I learned today!

## Defining and getting used to Syntax

## Algebra using power and subscripting (very similar to LaTeX)

<img src="/images/mathematica/maths_002.png" width="300">\

## More typesetting

<img src="/images/mathematica/maths_003.png" width="500">

## Precision in calculations (this is with 30 digits of precision)

<img src="/images/mathematica/maths_004.png" width="500">

## One-based indexing

<img src="/images/mathematica/maths_005.png" width="300">

## Appending to a list

<img src="/images/mathematica/maths_006.png" width="500">

## Appended List with pi and finding the Length of a List

<img src="/images/mathematica/maths_007.png" width="500">

##  Substitution

<img src="/images/mathematica/maths_008.png" width="300">

## Plotting a function

<img src="/images/mathematica/maths_009.png" width="500">

## Defining the Plot Range

## Adding Details to the Plot

## Functions Learned 

```
Alt+7 -> Enter mode 
Ctrl + ( -> Math mode 
Ctrl + _ -> subscript
Ctrl + space -> out of subscript mode 
Ctrl + ^ -> power 
Ctrl + / -> (fractions) and arrow down for denominator
Ctrl + 2 -> square root
Alt + 7 -> type words (not mathematical commands)
Shift + Enter -> Evaluate
Alt + . -> Abort Computation

a2 = N[2, 20] -> 2 means 2 is numerical
and 20 is accuracy (ie 20 decimals)

------------------------------

one-based indexing
Length[Listname] -> gives length of list

---------
Plotting 
---------
functiontoplot = x + 5 
Plot[function, {x, value, value}, PlotRange->
{range1, range2}, PlotStyle->{Thick,Color}]

Two figures overlapping -> Show[Figure1, Figure2]

```

## Things to do

- Continue with Nanodegree (finish up lessons and get to Project by end of this week..hopefully)
- Finish Application (probably will be done by Wednesday)
- Continue with Mathematica tutorials and experimentation (when you obtain book, read and work through)
