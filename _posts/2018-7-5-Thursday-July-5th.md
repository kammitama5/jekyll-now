## GSoC Day 53 and a glimmer of hope

## I'm staying up to work on Haskell

- Typeclasses still are difficult for me to wrap my head around.
  It isn't clear to me exactly the usage of the ```type```, the ```constructor``` and how to 
  make the ```instance``` type-check. I think that I've gotten better at composing types, 
  based on going back to the exercises, but typeclasses are still something I really need to *work* on.
  I'm going into whack-a-mole/monkey-mode when I work with typeclasses, which means I don't understand it,
  because I'm not reasoning through the problems. So it means I need to slow down and probably also get some
  assistance.
- It may sound trivial, but when you're learning, it's really *not*. And the fact that it's so obvious
  to people who have already figured it out is just *daunting*. I still feel like even though I can
  warble through exercises, it hasn't clicked yet.
- [*This*](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150PLD/Notes/TypeClasses.pdf) was extremely helpful! I also
  waded through the internet and found a bunch of people who thought it was sort of a wart of Haskell,
  and others who thought it was super powerful, so I dunno. I'm just trying to fully understand it, here.
- Some of it is vaguely reminding me of C++, but I don't know if that's just confusing me. Using the word
  *overloading* over and over. And *constructor*. W-H-Y :(

## I feel really awful

- But Haskell *legit* distracts me from work. So I'd actually say my part-time gig is half-Haskell. All 
  I think about and make notes on is Haskell. The other day I was looking for a clean sheet of paper
  and all I could find were ones with lambda calculus and notes all over them. :(

## I also got some really good advice

- "Dad-advice" from Gabe. Something really great happened to me today (that I can't talk about but if it is for real,
  I'll talk about it once I can!),
but I was conflicted, and he gave me
  really great advice about the situation. I'm pretty sure he's a good father. I sort of heard my own father's voice
  as he wrote me back; it was *weird*. Oh no...what if they're the same person LOL. 
  
## What's "dad" advice?

- Dad advice is the voice of reason. It's rooted in reminding you of your values and character. It comes from
  someone usually with experience and wisdom and maturity. Most of my friends are 2x my age, so they give 
  some solid "dad advice". It's the kind of thing you look back on weeks after and you go "hmm..that was kind 
  of profound...there is a whole *dimension* of this I hadn't thought of before." It's like you have to grow
  up yourself to really understand what the person is trying to tell you. I don't really get that from my peers
  or the general programming community. I think that some of it comes from being worldly. It's different.
  A really good friend of mine who did that *all the time* (and wasn't my dad) was a high-school dropout who
  started his own business from scratch and was pretty much a multi-millionnaire by the time he was in his 30s
  (if not before). He just thought about everything differently, and understood people and motivation. I was
  always super impressed by him because he always had a great work ethic and a sense of purpose about his life.
  I often have felt like my peers care too much about what other people think; he never had that. He was *free*.
  
- A friend of mine was talking about literature today; fascinated by a book. But it was something I had
  read in school. A few years ago, I would borrow 45 books at a time from the library. I wanted to understand
  those people, and why they thought what they put to paper was important. I think about that a lot, especially
  in the world of programming. You can blog, but does that make it important? Does it have permanence?
- And what is your world really if you just hang out with the same kinds of people? 
  
## Imposter

- I still have that feeling...like I don't deserve *any* of this. I think that maybe everything will fall down
   like a house of cards, and all the good things that have happened were sort of a fluke, or that they will run
   thin. I still don't quite remember how I got here...But I keep going because...Haskell. What's not to love? :D
