## Twitter's ML Flock event

## I'm doing a dangerous thing
- I'm starting a post while waiting for my flight to board. So we'll see how far this goes :)

## I went to New York
- I was invited to an event by Twitter called MLFlock (with hash tag MLFlockTalk) specifically for PhD students who have
  some aspect of Machine Learning in their research. It was a really great event because we did roundtables, or rather, 
  rotations, with ML engineers in teams within Twitter, in groups of about five each.
- So each group of five ML students had an opportunity to speak with about one to two engineers in twenty minute segments.
  I got a lot out of it, as well as the general presentation on Academia to Industry. That specifically was a panel in which
  engineers on the teams spoke about differences between both experiences, and spoke about their backgrounds and impact at
  Twitter.
  
## It felt just about right
- The size was great for the event, because you felt like you really had a chance to speak with the people in ML at this event.
  It was definitely pretty flattering because of how much access we received. I would definitely attend another similar event!
