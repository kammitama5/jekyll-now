## Out on the Water again

- So I've been quite busy with my Udacity course.
  I didn't *plan* on being out on the water today,
  but an opportunity came and I couldn't resist. 
  So...
  
## Boy was it fun!

- It made me realize how much I enjoy it! 
  I had a big smile on my face by the time I boarded the boat.
  
## There was a mini Barbecue 

- So the dockmaster had a party for boat owners. It was more of a pot-luck,
  but I scored a coupon for a free taco at Sharky's, had some food 
  and drink, but not too much because I hate eating or drinking a lot
  before sailing (unless it's water-based fruit like grapes or strawberries).
  
## Then we were off..

- And joy of joys, what did you know..the Attessa IV was in our marina!

## She has a helicopter on there. 
- I heard it's about 400K just to refill (gas) her.

## So next week

- We're planning on going to Redondo for lunch (sailing there),
  and then sailing back to MDR. That should be a blast! 
  
- We may also go to Catalina at some point. There is a big party
  usually in September there with a lot of boats from the marina.
  
## Here is also a GPS chart

- (started a bit late) from our trip today

## Tomorrow

- strictly working on Python stuff for my assignment. Should be 
  done by Thursday, which is still a week before it's due :)
