## Making, Technology and Humans

## I've had this weird relationship with technology
- A person I made friends with this week (at large unnamed tech company) and I were speaking about our relationships with
  technology. As it turns out, we both had experiences with similar locations, and saw it change with time. When I came
  back from the Bay area to pack (I lived in the [North Hollywood Arts district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoHo_Arts_District,_Los_Angeles), which was for artists and filmmakers and
  budding actors getting their foot in the door when I first moved there), it was heavily gentrified and I barely recognized
  my own neighbourhood. It was terrifying and I was almost happy to leave and start a new chapter, even though my heart ached from leaving a place I lived for so many years. There were so many
  people who looked like what I was. No more [Millenium Dance Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Millennium_Dance_Complex); they had long moved. And all the nook artist galleries
  were slowly losing their leases; who can afford to pay their employees $14 a day and pay rent there anymore?
- As I have said many times, I've always been this hybrid art-techie person, so that means I've lived at the intersection
  of having both friends in the Arts, or in Tech, or anything in between. I've also been at both ends of the spectrum in
  terms of experiencing the struggle of living on a mattress (my first visit to San Francisco; which was to draw with a 
  friend, and stayed in the Tenderloin district) and the luxury of working in Silicon Valley.
  
## What I'd like to talk about
- One of my first interactions, however, was through a school I joined that was a direct result of technology disrupting
  art. It was a school created by the Film Industry (specifically the Animation industry) to help artists transition
  from 2D to 3D. You see, at the time, huge studios were laying off 2D artists and hiring more and more 3D and vfx artists,
  as the studios were convinced that the future was 3D; 3D vfx, 3D movies, 3D art.
- I was given the privilege (because I was a full-time employee working in entertainment) of being trained in these
  classes for free, but some of my peers were also given grants because they were unemployed, and this school was a solution
  set up by the union to help these artists transition to find work.
- It was the first time I sat in a class as a young whipper-snapper (ha!) quickly grasping the 3D concepts and enjoying
  the new world of software and how it could create art. But it was also incredibly humbling that sitting beside me
  were persons who had garned several of the highest awards in Hollywood, but who had found themselves out of work
  because "no one wants 2D drawings anymore". And therefore, I unwittingly found myself at the intersection of the effects
  of technology disruption on people I personally interacted with and knew. Many of them were older artists, veterans of
  the industry; if I mentioned their names, people would look in awe. And yet, they were out of work.
  
## A second time
- The film industry, like tech, is filled with these disruptions. Another incident was the dwindling of film as a technology
  for shooting movies, and the growing enthusiasm by directors and producers for using video. All of a sudden, young
  people with barely ten years of experience who bought video cameras were just as hirable (in theory, not in terms of skill
  necessarily) as veteran cinematographers, and everyone was scrambling for work. The third was the advent of smaller cameras
  and streaming or "webisodes", which meant that the film industry no longer needed large crews to shoot movies. Instead
  of, in the 90s, million dollar music videos and lots of 50 million dollar budget movies, now there were just 200 million
  dollar movies that everyone wanted to get on, and movies that were 150 dollars a day. 
  
## As someone at the intersection of humans and technology
- Today, I am again at the intersection of humans and technology, researching privacy, fairness and machine learning. 
  It's a difficult place to be in, as some people might see me as on the "side that is the problem". I remember clearly
  when I told the very friend I went to San Francisco with that I was getting more into programming 
  (I drifted into it by accident; it was the last thing I ever intended to do), they decided that
  I was a "sellout", and shortly thereafter, our friendship ended. The two can't exist together, they thought.
  What was ironic to me about it is that many of these artists out of necessity *had* to transition to digital sketching
  tools, Cintiqs and Wacoms, to make a living. But they still saw a clear divide between the world of artists and the 
  world of "those people" in tech. 
- I cannot change who I am today, and it's been a journey, but I have those sensitivies about who I was, who I am and
  my future path, and they inform questions I have about the ethical nature of technology.
  
## Anyways
- Here is one of the first renders I did in Solidworks at night school
