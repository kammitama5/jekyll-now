## GSoC Day 52

## Happy July 4th!

- Sadly, I'm *not* on a boat tonight (see last year's post). I actually opted to do Haskell all day today, and time just flew by.
- Specifically, I just wanted to practice types and get better at it. I did this by revisiting Chapter 5
  of Hbook. I'm currently on Chapter 10.
- It was really a *lot* easier than it was the first time. There was one I wasn't able to quite solve,
  but the rest were pretty straight-forward. I'm actually really proud seeing the improvement.
- I was actually thinking of making a repo called "Haskell_Hell" that is just a list of type-checking exercises
  that you could spend all day doing to practice. But I need to get better at it myself first, to make sure they work.
  The name is appropriate because right now that stuff is a PITA for me.
  
## I didn't grill or anything
- But I did make some curried crab. If I had more time, I'd also make dumpling, which is what it's *supposed* to go with,
  but alas. I spent most of the time musing about where I'd like to be in the near future and working on Haskell.
- I think one of my internships is having a bar-hangout thing tomorrow, but since I have no life (jk), I'm going to skip on that.
  Not really into the social stuff right now. I'm mostly just tired from working and working and then I go to sleep. Repeat.
  I ended up skipping *the* bus on the way home and leaving a bit earlier and taking four buses home instead because it
  gets me home a bit earlier so I can eat and take a nap before pair-programming with Chris. Power-napping is awesome.
- The whole local commute thing really is kind of b@lls. Telecommuting please be a thing.
- And basically I spend my time just feeling like I'm not good enough because everyone was in diapers programming in the
  hospital...before their umbilical cord was cut. Except me.
- So shallow socializing just makes me feel more behind on everything and I think it's stupid trying to force myself to relate
  to people where I currently live because I don't..have much...in common...with the people here...my age.
  I have no interest in getting drunk and seeing fireworks, but I do care about the history of the US, and what it
  stands for. As an immigrant, that means more to me, and the promise of opportunity. I think about my family. I miss them.
- I really like my JPL mentor, though; he's probably three times my age (LOL) but I relate to him a *lot* more. He always
  knows how to say the most perfect things, like when I was complaining about hostile Haskell-land, and he joked (okay,
  there was some fervour in his words) that he could interest me in some Fortran. It made me feel better.
  
## One more thing...The weird thing about listening to a playlist on loop
- Is that you have no sense of time. So five hours passed this morning before I took a break and I had no idea. I sat down
  to work and time just flew by.
- I also got a suprise contact today by someone from PLDI. I really like the people, but I can't commit to anything until
  after mid-August. I'm just really swamped. I have to get back to work. But if it works it out, I'd love to take them up
  on the offer.
  
## That's it for me
