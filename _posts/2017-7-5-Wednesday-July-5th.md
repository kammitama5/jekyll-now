## Just Fireworks (July 4th evening recap)

## Got some cool pics...

- I'm sharing! I *love* sailing!

## On a 36'-er 

- I went with a group. It was lovely. 
  I didn't stay for the after-party on the dock, as 
  I needed to get home, but it was really fun. 
  A lot of the group was from the vicinity (Manhattan Beach,
  Redondo, etc). Quite a few East Coasters, too. 

## Here we are leaving our slip and heading to the barge.

- MDR (Marina Del Rey) has a barge with Fireworks.
  If you're on a boat, your best bet is to get as close to the 
  barge (but within the limits of the other boats policing the barge)
  and you'll be *right under* the fireworks!

## We got a great spot this year

- We're literally *under* the fireworks! It was beautiful!
  You could smell the sulphur afterwards, though.
  There were crowds lining the marina on land.
  But we had the best view from our sailboats and yachts :)

## You still have to wrestle the kayaks and motorboats, though

- In sailing culture and on the water, contrary to television,
  no-one really cares for the powerboats. 
  Someone once yelled "All you needed was a license and a cheque book"
  at some powerboat. 
  
- It's telling, because often you don't find powerboaters who have
  the same kind of consideration (and skill-level) as you do some of the 
  other boaters. And..the powerboaters tend to *love* speeding.
  Not great on a night like July 4th, where boats in the marina are
  *bumper to bumper*, while drifting, with the motor off...
  
- So...*why do you have your motor on again!?*

## Interesting yacht

- Probably owned by a billionnaire. I only took a photo
  to find out who the owner was, out of curiosity.
  
- I've actually seen quite a few of these in this Marina.

- Dennis Washington's boat (I guess it's a super-yacht) was on 
  the water the first time I had been sailing in LA. Also, 
  Frank Gehry's very fanciful boat.

## I love sailing...but I'm still learning

- I like it because it takes time to get really good,
  and it's perfect if you have an analytical mind.

- I did a bit of rowing in school (and my dad also 
  was also a Sea Scout, and my brother has done 
  Dragon-boat racing), so I know a bit, but I'm still learning.
  
- In sailnig, you have to constantly be aware of your surroundings,
  while looking at details.
  
- It's also great if you are into astronomy because in 
  navigation, it comes in handy

## Kata
-Replace every instance of "Coffee" (RegEx)

```
function coffee(str) {
 
 str = str.replace(/coffee|Coffee|coFFEE/g, 'COFFEE');
 return str;
}
```

## Oh, and I *did* get some work done, too!
