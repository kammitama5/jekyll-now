## Rust Hackday 2018

## Today we wrapped up RustConf with an optional Hack-Day at Mozilla

- But first...we met at the Portland Farmer's Market!

- I got there a bit early and got a cup of tea at a nearby coffee shop.
  I also walked around and took a few photos.

- I couldn't decide whether to wear my NASA tshirt or my Rust tshirt, and decided
  on the RustConf one. That turned out to be a good decision!

- I asked one person along the way where it was, and after he gave me
  directions, he said "and thank you for using Rust!". Turns out, he works
  for Mozilla and had noticed my tshirt was a Rust one! :D

## We met at the Farmer's Market

- It was a group of about 12 of us. We went to different booths, and
  as soon as I had ordered, the guy taking my order started speaking
  *excitedly* about WASM and Rust. It was pretty hilarious. Soon,
  the rest of our group gathered around and was talking back and forth with
  him. We told him he should definitely speak at RustConf next year!
  Again, my Rust tshirt! :D A bunch of us ended up supporting his booth, too.
  The food was quite tasty!

- He was working at the Green Tang booth, and his github name is 
  ```greenpdx```. You can find his github [here](https://github.com/greenpdx).

- I also had an amazing dosa!

## Finally, we got to Mozilla 
- I got my badge, and Michael *photo-bombed* my sign-in photo! :D

- This lady here is responsible for RustReach. Just wanted to 
  point that out :D

- I *truly* love her and appreciate how kind and generous she has been to me.
  She works her butt off, but has an incredible sense of humour. 
  
## I worked with Nick and Jeena
- Jeena was working on Turtle, and Nick showed me some benchmarking tools
  in a library called ```criterion```. By inlining functions, we were
  able to improve the performance of the code! We also looked at 
  Disassembly to optimize code and figure out what was taking up most of our
  time when running the code. I'm really thankful he showed that to me,
  and I'm really interested in learning more about the Linux Kernel and how
  that works now. 

- I also made two pull requests to fix two issues. Nick is really patient 
  and humble and it was really great to work with both of them.
  
## Oh..and we took a break and went for shaved ice!

## Finally
- At the end of the day, we called it a day and went home after
  HackDay. Really great day today!
