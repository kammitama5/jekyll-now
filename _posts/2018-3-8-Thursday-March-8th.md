## Little Puzzles with Haskell

## Tried reworking some of my CodeWars puzzles

## String Repeat

- This was one to repeat a string given a char and number of times it is to be repeated

## Negative or Not (Some may be already)

- This is one to make a number negative if it isn't or otherwise leave it

## Remove first and Last

<img src="/images/hasky1/h_002.png" width="500">

- This was one to remove the head and last element of a list. In Python, you'd do this by slicing.
- In Haskell, I did this by using drop and take. Drop the 1st element lazily after the string is taken except the last element.

- Check out this solution, though. Drop the first. Reverse, drop the first (which is the last) and then reverse again. Woah! Sick! 


## Otherwise 

- On page 134 of Haskellbook. I'm quite enjoying it. 
- I also formatted my Statement of Purpose a bit.
- I spoke to my mentor, who is psyched about my Fortran assignment :D He wanted to know if I could us Fortran 2008 instead of 77 :D

## Doing Haskell
- Doing Haskell daily makes you ten times more excited to go to BayHac and those kinds of events. I mean, I'm *always* happy to 
  hang out with Haskellinos, but now I'm kind of *ecstatic*. I'm excited to see how my mind has changed since last year, and to 
  learn more.
