## MarinaFest, GSoC and RustReach Day 7

## GSoC AM
- I went to sleep around 2:30am. I was really struggling with getting some code to type-check.
  Specifically, I really thought it was a Double, but I was able to get it to type-check by using
  a Bool value. I wonder if there's a way to print out or trace directly specific values? I really
  felt like I was floundering and there was a lot of disbelief in my ability to complete the task
  by myself. 
- I was able to also able to move on to Rust Chapter 6. It's gotten steeper in terms of the learning curve.
  It's like everything has gotten steeper.
- I also have one assignment to complete for class, due on the 23rd. It's silly, but I should do it. Again,
  straight from the textbook.
  
## I got up at 5:30am
- Headed to volunteer at Marinafest. I haven't, as you may have noticed,  been sailing. Just because things have 
  been crazy, and programming is my first priority. I even had to turn down a race, but the captain likes me so 
  he told me I'm up for the next one. So we'll see. So I thought that this may make up for some of the time 
  I haven't been around. It was only for two hours or so, and everyone asked where I was and how I was, but well..life.

## I was so tired
- I fell asleep for the entirety of the 45 to an hour long train ride from Santa Monica to downtown LA.
  Completely knocked out. :/
- I guess I really want to push myself, but I also have a fair amount going on.

## Tonight
- I'll stay up and do some Rust and Haskell
- Hopefully also either do laundry tonight or tomorrow and pack for house-sitting Tuesday night/ Wednesday night.
  Basically, I'm collecting the keys tomorrow afternoon and heading over by my friend Tuesday evening, but I need
  my two laptops and clothes for work on Tuesday, so..yeah..organization. 
- It would be nice sometime to just have normal-time to myself. Kind of like "what did you do this weekend?" 
  "Oh nothing..just go out drinking with friends." Comfortable life, you know? Maybe one day.
