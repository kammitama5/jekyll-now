## Systems of Theft

## A new rabbit hole
- I met a bunch of people today through a new space, and it made me smile, because they were all interesting.
Meeting them reminded me of being in Los Angeles in the Arts community, where people would weave in and out, where you
might pop in and see that the VFX Supervisor for the currently [10-time Oscar winning movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Pi_(film)) that year was casually taking 
a drawing class and sitting next to you, or a Mathematician doing her PhD in Topology was taking a painting class with you.
- I left the space excited. The whole group has this energy, this momentum, like we are all sitting on the edge of something new. 
And when I say "new", I don't mean one that is defined by the feudalistic approaches and hierarchical structures that *allow* a definition of new, but new-new.
Everyone there was *so* refreshing to meet. I left the group and had a moment where I caught my breath and thought "wow. This is SUPER cool. My advisor *might* 
kill me, but WOW.". It energized me. 

## Innovation in Hierarchical Structures
- One of the things that has been interesting to me about Academia is that I am seeing striking resemblances to some other industries I've been a part of,
where the higher up you are, you are rewarded for "innovation". My advisor and I had a brief discussion about it this week, because it had been pointed out that
on the lower levels of Academia, or say, being a PhD student, you are not rewarded for truly being creative. When people invest in you on this level, it is because
you have done the things that are instructed of you. Someone you work for or with may be doing particularly novel work, but at that level, there isn't a real way
to determine if *you* are particularly doing novel work, the system is structured so that your work is really a reflection of your obedience and loyalty to a higher
power. 
- You are promised that if you stick with it, you will have the opportunity to express your creativity. This seems really strange to me, because it means that if
you are truly a creative person, but you lack resources, or the ability to stick out the process for whatever reasons, you may never have an opportunity in that
very structure to see any of those creative ideas come to fruition. Unless, of course, it is stolen by someone with more power, more clout. 
- I have seen this for myself in such systems as the film industry, where everyone asks "why are we making another sequel", but you can pick up a stone and throw
it and find *incredibly* talented people who are struggling. If you are such a person, what does it take for you to look inside yourself, for years of struggling,
with a lack of support, pitching your ideas and possibly seeing them stolen (this happens a lot!), for the opportunity that one day the world *might* be able 
to pair your ideas with your identity? Maybe that's part of why we see the people we see rise to the top in that industry? 
- I had a bizarre experience recently where something I was really definitively talking about as something I wanted to do, and had written a proposal for, kept
getting rejected. But strangely, I went to an event of large company, and they began essentially saying that their work would be in that direction, and 
I know that they had read my proposal. At the time I thought it was funny, and had thought to myself cynically that they probably shouldn't pitch it to organization 
X, Y or Z because they wouldn't give you funding for it. I watched
a video a while ago by [Louis Rossmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6fGOXWO0w4&t=1s), where he talks about how you can control your reaction when these things happen. When you get screwed, you lose if you lose
your head, if you let it get to you. I've had a history of being stolen from, on so many levels, across various fields. The funny part is that it was usually while
the higher-ups were telling me I was too much of a smart-ass and needed to learn my place. Your place is that you are here to be pilfered from, to be a vehicle 
that hides our mediocrity. You are here to be *used*.

## This isn't new
- I come from a region that, if you ever had the time, would give you a long list of examples of being stolen from in terms of ideas. 
- Imagine coming from an island of 1 million people, travelling to Europe, and hearing a song by another European artiste that had just come out that year,
and everyone told you that the song was really catchy, even though you knew the song seven years ago as being sung by a local, unknown composer. This happened
*a lot* when I was growing up, and even in my parents' time. Let's just say that there is a lot of eye-rolling and a lack of trust because of how frequently
it happens. When you are an unknown, who will you turn to in order to protect your ideas? And lest you say "it's not ideas that matter; it's the execution",
I'd like to remind you that in many cases, these songs *were* recorded, and if the situation were reversed, the small, island artist would be *heavily* sued.
I believe there's a type of moprhism in Maths for that; the one that only goes in one direction. I'm taking a class on that stuff next semester. A ring of thievery
and lies. I don't think that's a subfield but maybe it should be.

## How do you sustain your creativity in systems that penalize innovation at the lower level?
- In film, there's a common saying at the lower levels; "we hired you from the neck down". I've never thought about it this way, but maybe that also means that 
"if you have ideas, for the people at the top, your ideas are fair game, and we can profit off of them". 
- What does that mean for sustaining oneself in such a system? I have been taking this Artificial Worldbuilding class, and we were looking at [Sandspiel](https://sandspiel.club/#),
which is a simulator for things such as sand, water, fire, etc. I noticed that eventually, everything would go up in flames. The world would eat itself whenever I
spent time on simulations involving sand, water, fire, lava, fungus, plants, etc. What does that say about permanence or longevity of certain systems?
- So back to my initial group; I'd like to use it as a space that seems to want to move away from a lot of the systems I've observed over the years, and developed
a distaste for, while telling you that you should be lucky to be a part of it, and feel demoralized if you have been deemed not worthy. A space that's just not
for power-hungry A-holes. What can we build, whose ideas can we lift up? What can we create and how do we preserve accountability? Time will tell.

## And that's it
