## Cassini Finale and C

- As Cassini winds down, there was quite a lot of information and activity from JPL.
- I would be honoured to intern there next year!
- Oh, I'm racing on a boat on the 24th, one day after my LinkedIn event :)

## Learning C

- My professor is not a fan of C because she loves OOP.
  So naturally, I started learning some C. So far, it's *very* fun!
  I'm enjoying taking little programmes from C++ and making them into C programmes.
  
- Compiling is as easy as ```gcc -o filename filename.c``` and then ```filename```

- Also did a bit of using make file by using ```make filename``` and ```./filename``` in the CS50 Cloud9 IDE.
  This was a method used for CS50. I just started a *little* bit of CS50 via EdX, but it's kind 
  of slow for me, and I'm *losing my mind*. So...we'll see. Maybe I'll just review 
  pointers and structs and stuff and objects and oh wait...it doesn't have objects :P. 
  Chris mentioned [GObject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GObject). 
  The people on FP Chat are amazeballs. One person casually mentioned another had *made* 
  a garbage collector. Wut. It seems you can't throw a rock in that community without 
  hitting someone who has *made* a language, or at least certainly a compiler. 
  They inspire me.
  
- Back to CS50...There is still stuff I can get out of it. 

- I got bored...so I made a text-based cli [goblin game](https://github.com/kammitama5/C_rebellion/blob/master/goblin.c) :)

- The FP community (via FP Chat) was also *incredibly* helpful in pointing out resources
  and things of which I should take note. I think it's a good thing that I'm learning some C.

## Things to think about

- sequence points

## Things to do

- Continue learning C
- Review Objects, Structs, Pointers
- Work through Nanodegree and final project
