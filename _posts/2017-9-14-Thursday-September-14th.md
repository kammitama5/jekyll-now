## Cassini Finale and C

- As Cassini winds down, there was quite a lot of information and activity from JPL.
- I would be honoured to intern there next year!

## Learning C

- My professor is not a fan of C because she loves OOP.
  So naturally, I started learning some C. So far, it's *very* fun!
  I'm enjoying taking little programmes from C++ and making them into C programmes.
  
- Compiling is as easy as ```gcc -o filename filename.c``` and then ```filename```

- The FP community (via FP Chat) was also *incredibly* helpful in pointing out resources
  and things of which I should take note. I think it's a good thing that I'm learning some C.

## Things to think about
