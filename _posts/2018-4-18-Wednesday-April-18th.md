## Open Source and Progress

## I just got back from an Open Source Meetup!

- It's specifically this [one](https://www.meetup.com/la-fullstack/), where we stand in a circle, introduce ourselves,
  talk about what we'd like to work on. Then we are paired and work with a partner via the [Pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) method.
  
- My requests were "No Java" and "No JavaScript". And so naturally, my partner was a Java Programmer :D
- So, we settled on trying Rust. We got through a couple of the [excercism problems](https://github.com/exercism/rust).
- At the end, we had a retrospective, and I thought it interesting that my partner for the exercise immediately commented
  that I had "a lot more patience than he did", even though he was a seasoned programmer.
  
## On the way home
- My friend who ran the Meetup and myself were talking; he's a good friend.
- He said that a mutual friend of ours (who opted to become a PM) said she once met a developer who 
  was from the Ukraine who said they learned with pencil and paper, and finally compiled their programme once a month.
- I loved that, because it very much reminded me of the sort of process we were going through for my Programming Languages class.
- I thought that sometime throughout the semester, something mentally shifted for me. Don't get me wrong; I still have a *lot* to
  learn. But I've become more patient. Something about doing a different obscure language every two weeks *and* learning Haskell,
  and reading through a 458 page paper on the [Implementation of Functional Programming languages](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/1987/01/slpj-book-1987-small.pdf)
  I think (I hope) has made me better.
- I think that that is the sort of thing I'm looking for if I get the chance to study a PhD one day. The opportunity to *think* and 
  *understand* what crafting quality software really is, and the opportunity to fail. 
- With a lot of structured programmes, students aren't given the opportunity to fail and really accept failure. Everything is focused
  on doing well and passing. But so much of getting *good* at programming is about failing. It's a paradox.
  
## Anyways
- I'm also booked for a race in May, on this wonderful boat I sailed on last weekend.
- I'm doing a few interviews and just seeing what the future holds. Wherever I end up,
  I hope they can have the patience with me to help me grow and become a good developer.
