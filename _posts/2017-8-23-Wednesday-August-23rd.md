## Mathematica Cont'd

- I have about two more sets of lessons to go, and am reading through their documentation.

- So far, so good. A gentleman from their company even got in touch with me about how they could
  give me the best experience during my trial, which I thought was really great.
  
## Solving algebraic problems in Mathematica

- It of course does imaginary numbers

- Note the ```==```, because ```=``` is for assignment

## Use Simplify or Expand

- It does just that, as best it can

- Bear in mind, it's finding any given number of solutions, not just one.

## Based on your criteria, you can narrow the range, or ask for a specific solution

## While loops

- You can create a loop as such

- Create a list
- Create a second list that will be filtered into
- Write loop, starting with k value
- Do something to each value of k 
- Append this new and updated value of k to the second list
  for a specific number of iterations (start, stop)
- Print filtered second list 

- There are even functions that are built in, like GCD of the returned list,
  or if there are prime numbers in there, etc. Very interesting!

## Tables

- You can create Tables, which are a sequence of k for each 
  value along a sequence of a function

- I have some questions about Tables. I don't quite fully understand them.

## Time to go through documentation!

- So far, so good.

## Things to be done 

- Continue two last chunks of Mathematica (you only have 13 days left)
- Do Nanodegree project (due Sept 22nd)
- Do application (Sunday)
