## 5/7/17 - Day of Rest

## Reflection

I spent yesterday taking a break from people, and reading up on the BlackJack and the IBM 704.
My friends from the Haskell group have called me an Extrovert because I like tech raves
ie specifically raves at tech conferences :) 
but I think of myself as more of an Extroverted Introvert. 

People exhaust me, so after talking to many of them, I'll just completely withdraw.
Sometimes, I'll just stay at home for an entire day with the lights out. 

Anyways...

I'm solved this kata in Python. 
It was fun...
Basically, you have this word "say blah"
and you need to compare it with a "bath" ie "|~~~~~~|"
Can the word fit in the bath?

My solution

```
def bath(s,x):
    a = len(x) - 2
    b = len(s) 
    if a < b:
        return True
    else:
        return False
		
		# s is a word "blah"
		# x is a bath in format |~~~~|
```

This is another one I'm working on.
It passes the test case, but not the general tests. Plus, it's long.

```
var color2grey = function (image) {
      var total = 0;
      var total1 = 0;
      var total2 = 0;
      var total3 = 0;
      
      var a1 = []
      var b1 = []
      var c1 = []
      var d1 = []
      
      var a = image[0][0]
      var b = image[0][1]
      var c = image[1][0]
      var d = image[1][1]
      //a
      for (var i =0 ; i < a.length; i++)
      {
        total = total + a[i]
      }
      avg1 = total / 3
      a1.push(avg1)
      for (var i = 1; i < a.length; i++)
      {
        a1.push(avg1)
      }
      //b
      for (var i =0 ; i < b.length; i++)
      {
        total1 = total1 + b[i]
      }
      avg2 = parseInt(total1 / 3)
      b1.push(avg2)
      for (var i = 1; i < b.length; i++)
      {
        b1.push(parseInt(avg2))
      }
      //c 
      for (var i =0 ; i < c.length; i++)
      {
        total2 = total2 + c[i]
      }
      avg3 = parseInt(total2 / 3)
      c1.push(avg3)
      for (var i = 1; i < c.length; i++)
      {
        c1.push(parseInt(avg3))
      }
      //d
      for (var i =0 ; i < d.length; i++)
      {
        total3 = total3 + d[i]
      }
      avg4 = parseInt(total3 / 3)
      d1.push(avg4)
      for (var i = 1; i < d.length; i++)
      {
        d1.push(parseInt(avg4))
      }
      first = []
      second = []
      super1 = []
      
      first.push(a1)
      first.push(b1)
      second.push(c1)
      second.push(d1)
      super1.push(first)
      super1.push(second)
      
      return(super1)
      
}
```
