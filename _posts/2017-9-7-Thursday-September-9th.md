## Next couple of days..rundown

## Sailing Trip! 

- A group of us are going sailing to Catalina Island this weekend.
  It's a big hang-out every year, where about 15+ boats and about 75+ people
  hang out at 3am on dinghies over there and pass out food, we eat Barbecue and
  have raffles where you can win prizes and stuff. It's going to be a lot of fun
  and I will try to post a few pics!
  
- PS..I've *never* been to [Catalina island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Catalina_Island_(California)), nor have I sailed at night! This 
  should be FUN. We leave at 10pm on Friday and return by 4pm on Sunday.
  
## Sailing group

- Oh, and I also joined a sailing group for women. I want to learn how to race and 
  stuff. Well, I did *some* training a few years ago when I was in a rowing crew team,
  and I remember it to be really fun! It was a division 1 NCAA team, too, so the training
  was pretty rough, but also enjoyable. I definitely pushed myself physically.
  I also remember that the girls I trained with 
  became like family, because there is a certain amount of bonding that does happen
  when you're working as a team on a boat to compete/ win/ be your best. 

## Back to programming, though...

- So...continuing this week, was able to knock off quite a few things.

1. Cleaned up bugs from program
2. Finished chapter of Nanodegree.

## So that means

- On to next part of Nanodegree..basically final project.
  To be quite honest, I can't decide between Data Analyst or Back-End.
  I may do both? Not sure yet.
  
- I've decided to try a new version of my C++ programme. 
  Basically, it will also be OOP, but I'll start with a UML design.
  I want to see how this will improve the one that I solved. 
  It's not due until the 26th, so I still have a lot of time.
  
## Today

- My mentor from JPL and I are going to listen to some Jazz.
  We're also going to go through some PLT and start learning about
  DFAs and stuff. He works mostly in Fortran and C++, and is a 
  mathematician at his core (and Physicist, who works with numerical
  computation), so I really am grateful for this perspective. I think
  it will make me a better programmer. 
  
## So..plan
- Work on UML
- Work on C++ classes based on UML
- Continue with last part of Nanodegree
- Thurs (PLT lessons and jazz with mentor)
- Friday (pay membership fees for sailing group, get snacks on the way to 
  sailboat)...sail!
  
## Strange Loop is also coming up!

- It looks like it will be a lot of fun! Quite a few people I know are attending!
  I was also introduced to some members of the SF chapter of Papers We Love! 
  I'm excited to meet them in person! 

## Booked for Chrome Dev Summit

- Also attending that..my second year. It should be fun, too!

## Retrospect

- I had a really great week. During the break, a bunch of us had fun streaming.
  Rust and Haskell. It was really wonderful! 
  
- I pulled through a situation that had been bothering me emotionally. One of my friends was
  incredibly kind. He said "I think you'd make a great programmer!" It meant a lot to me. 
  
- I'm really enjoying everything. Last night, I really enjoyed C++ class. The class itself is a class,
  but C++ is such a beautiful language. I'm really enjoying learning it. I look at some Haskell code and 
  I kid you not, I see some C++ structure in there!
