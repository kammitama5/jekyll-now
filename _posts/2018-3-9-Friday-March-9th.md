## Old is New Again

## I went to SCALE today

- I actually spent the bulk of my time volunteering. It was nice catching up with everyone and the group
  of them was joking that for some reason I know *everyone*. It didn't feel that way, but it's pretty
  easy for me to be social in the tech community. Just my kind of people, I guess. 
  
## Some people got these soldered together

- The LCD displays Conway's Game of Life and has some other puzzles to solve. 
  The image is a rotary phone. That's actually pretty neat.

## So it's a pertinent tie-in. 

- My brain is still racking itself over the profundity of the conversation I had yesterday evening.
