## Up Late Building

## Hello from SF!
- It's been a busy few days. 
- I had class, met with my two mentors right afterwards, and had a great conversation about digging into the codebase.
  As it turns out, we have a great pace. I learned so much about my mentors that I never even knew, about their initial paths
  and how they had a sort of curvy path to their current success. It really meant a lot to speak to them in this way. 
  Also, I saw some ponies! :D
  
## And now I'm in a motel/hotel/hostel
- I don't know quite what to call it, but I'm doing some work, trying to get my project to build with warnings. So far, 
  so good. My machine wasn't able to pick up on another wifi I was on with my other laptop, so I was only just able to 
  get my project to build. But I'm making progress.
  
## I did code today though
- I learned a bit about ```clasp``` and ```Gradle``` and ```Android``` and ```Angular```. I completed four code labs,
  including one involving some machine learning. So that was really worthwhile and satisfying. I should be able to post 
  a photo (or some photos) from it at a later date. 
- Interestingly, I had a lot of anxiety today about just being able to get back to Haskell. The whole Android thing was not
  really my scene. But it was good to try, and I'm always happy to learn. 
  
## Oh, I may be dog-sitting
- I got an offer to dog-sit near the end of the month, so I'll probably be doing that near the end of the month :D

## Working through...
- I was able to set up ```-fwarn-incomplete-patterns``` and should be setting up to show all possible exceptions and errors,
  so I can work through them and fix them. I really like that Haskell is sort of incremental. You chip away at it.
  
## So I'm going to continue working
- Probably for about three or four more hours, then getting up two hours later to head out/ check out and all that.

## My friend was telling me
- Before I left, a friend of mine said he found that I was very passionate and his sister had said something to the extent of 
  how when you're far away from home, it forces you to figure out who you are. I thought that to be profound.
- It hasn't been easy, but figuring things out and failing, and still getting up and trying, being frustrated, finding a way,
  has definitely made me a stronger person and has reinforced certain values. It's definitely been worth it, even though the journey
  hasn't been easy.
