## Functionality and Bugs

## Continuing onward...

- I was able to continue working a bit on my game, and I hit a few issues / things to work on:
  - collision (need to figure out) with ground and player
  - if I had sound, the functionality slows down
  
- Once I figure out collision, I can start to work on jumping/ physics 
- When that is done, I need to work on possibly atmosphere, but I don't know if I'll have time for that
  within the bounds of the class. I figure I can continue on my own, in any case :)
  
## Learned about

- AABB collison vs Pixel based collision. 
  There is a really interesting book I'm looking at, also, in general, on Game Patterns. 
  I think that sort of stuff in general is really helpful.
