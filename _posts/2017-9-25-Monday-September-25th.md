## AccelerateU LA, Tensorflow and first race

## Tensorflow event

- Went to a Tensorflow (TF) event featuring Googler Josh Gordon,
  put on by the Google Developers Group of Los Angeles
  
  - The repo we used is [here](https://github.com/random-forests/tensorflow-workshop) 
  - We went over quickly the concepts of Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and CNNs (Convolutional Neural Nets)
  - Tensorflow and its relationship to Dataflow graphs
  - Linear equation ```y = m * x_placeholder + b``` where we don't have x yet, and m and b are are our tuning variables for TF
  - ```y``` is the value we want in the equation
  - your hyperparameter is your learning rate in TF
  - Softmax is essentially highest probability based on weight
  - ```y = w * x + b```, where w is your weight matrix
  - Here is the link to some [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rUDq1lOtXa9-utNqfkDWAnYoIfhKyiTJeyOYeeUatjg/edit#slide=id.g254d08e080_0_47) he also said would be of interest.
  I particularly like Slide 6 :) (FP to the rescue!)

## AccelerateU LinkedIn event

- So, a few weeks ago, two recruiters contacted me from LinkedIn, and asked me to apply to attend their 
  events to target University students about to graduate. I did, and was accepted.
  
- It was about 100 people, and we were split into Business and Tech recruits.

- It was a lot of fun and they even provided us with a professional headshot photographer!

- There was a board where they asked us what inspires us.

- People had stuff like Beyonce (haha) or their mom. 
  For me, I said the Functional Programming community. They encourage me
  to aspire for excellence.

- They fed us...

- And at the end they even gave us these amazing cupcakes

- I found red-velvet ones!

## The content

- Initially, we were given an opportunity to understand how to better 
  our chances in general of being recruited or just being seen.
  
- This was my favourite slide! :)

- Then, we were asked to do an exercise where we could interview and video-tape
  each other, and make observations based on that (based on a rubric)
  
- We were given lunch, and then split into groups based on our specialization.
  I was confused before attending, because I had been told *not* to bring a laptop
  unless you were in the non-tech specialization (kind of the opposite of what you'd expect!).
  I'm not sure what the business specialization did, but we did a programming/ coding challenge.
  
- We were shown the questions, and then went to separate rooms and worked in groups of about five 
  or six, and then we split up again into groups of two to actually code, once we had worked out
  how we would solve the problem. It was *very* helpful!

- We then went back into the general room, and there was a panel, in which they went through 
  what we should know to be properly prepared for most interviews.

- They finally told us that as specially-chosen for this event, we are encouraged to 
  reach out to the engineers we met, and to apply for their internships and jobs, which 
  will be opening up soon. They're growing quickly, so they are definitely looking for more people.
  
- I really liked their culture and generally how helpful and encouraging and supportive they were!
  Also, the people who attended were all *lovely*. I made *so* many new friends. Really great!
