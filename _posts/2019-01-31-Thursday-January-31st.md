## The Most Amazing place in the Whole World

## I spent my week in the most amazing place in the entire world....MSRI

## What is MSRI

- It's pretty much a utopia for researchers, particularly those interested in
  Mathematical sciences.
  
## This is what Maths utopia looks like

## First time there

- It was my first time in Berkeley and at MSRI. 
  I was *super* nervous. I had also never been to Berkeley before. 
  
- On top of that, my bus cancelled 20 minutes before it was scheduled to leave,
  and I had to rely on a random stranger to help me book a new ticket with his phone
  so I could get on a totally different bus. It somehow all worked out, and two hours
  after my original expected time, I was in Berkeley, on the Hill shuttle, headed
  to MSRI.
