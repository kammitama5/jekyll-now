## The Most Amazing place in the Whole World

## I spent my week in the most amazing place in the entire world....MSRI

## What is MSRI

- It's pretty much a utopia for researchers, particularly those interested in
  Mathematical sciences.
  
- I stumbled upon [MSRI](http://www.msri.org/web/msri/scientific/workshops) and IAS through Numberphile, and other videos I found while learning
  about Mathematics and Haskell.

- On a whim, I applied for a grant and to attend their workshops, particularly for their workshops that pertained to
  Category Theory. I was surprised to discover that I had been accepted for two grants for both workshops.

## First time there

- It was my first time in Berkeley and at MSRI. 
  I was *super* nervous. I had also never been to Berkeley before. 
  
- On top of that, my bus cancelled 20 minutes before it was scheduled to leave,
  and I had to rely on a random stranger to help me book a new ticket with his phone
  so I could get on a totally different bus. It somehow all worked out, and two hours
  after my original expected time, I was in Berkeley, on the Hill shuttle, headed
  to MSRI.

 ## The Place

- The building was decorated with posters of people I have looked at from afar, inspired.
  At one point, I saw a gentleman stand in front of a poster, and realized it was the same
  gentleman *in* the poster! There are blackboards everywhere, and you can see people furiously
  turning coffee and tea (available at all hours) into Derived Algebraic Geometry.

 ## The people
 
 - The people I met were incredibly kind, on the first day, I joined
   a group of about ten of us for Tibetan food in downtown Berkeley.
   We ended the day by playing Jenga and eating Gelato in the Gourmet Ghetto.
   
 - MSRI itself feels very intimate; it's a place where you can meet the giants of the Mathematical Sciences
   casually and have a discussion about research you are working on. It's ideal because if you have cited
   or have been reading their work, you can simply ask questions and work on blackboards over tea or coffee.

 ## By the second day
 
 - I ended up hanging out with a plethora of people who knew me by name,
   we took a group photo, I was incredibly inspired to no longer be a programmer
   and just focus on Tropical Geometry instead.

 ## By the third day
 
 - A group of seven of us took a 50 minute hike from MSRI all the way to downtown
   Berkeley, had Thai food, and then went to a bar for a drink. I was heartbroken
   by the time I had to pack my bags and head out. The people are incredibly
   passionate and kind at MSRI. They love research and mathematics, and are 
   incredibly intellectually curious, with incredible wit.

 ## The conference itself
 
 - I was fortunate enough to be sponsored for the two conferences; 
   one was focused on women in research, particularly with an interest
   in Derived Algebraic Geometry and Bi Rational Moduli Spaces. We were
   fortunate enough to be able to speak with several researchers both in
   academia and in industry. One who stuck out for me that I was able to 
   speak with is Kristin Lauter, who is a mathematician/ computer scientist
   who works for Microsoft Reseach in Redmond on Crytography. 
   
 ## There was a poster session
 
 - Unlike CS poster events that I have attended, there was no cash prize,
   and there was less of a focus on the school the person was attending. 
   Posters were also not sponsored by industry (Google, Mozilla, etc).
   
 ## In conclusion
 
 - I definitely plan to return. Coming here has made me realize that I'm more 
   excited by research than I am learning frameworks in programming, or anything
   like that. It was absolutely worth it for me and I plan to become a member
   and attend as many events as I can.
