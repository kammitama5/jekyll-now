## Why are you up at 1am?

## I just got back from my C++ Data Structures Exam.

- I feel great. Really full of energy.
  I actually had a revelation in the middle of the exam.
  Something clicked. 

- I went "ohhhh..." and then my programmes COMPILED. 
  I enjoyed the exam. It was fun! 
  
I heard..not so much for others...

Hahah. I have some colourful friends! 

## A kata
- I also solved this kata:
  Find first x multiples of y:
  eg. mult(3, 4) gives [3, 6, 9, 12]
  
```
function mult(x, y){
  var arr = [];
  for (var i = 1; i <= x; i++)
  {
    arr.push(y * i)
  }
  return(arr);
}
```
## Onward soldier! 

- C++ is really growing on me.
  I spent a lot of today reading through and working on some OpenGL stuff.
  I plan to continue with that.
  
- I also have some work to do for this week's "Unbootcamp".

## Also...

- I'm going to an event at Netflix today. We'll see how that goes...
  should be interesting.
  
- Also, I got my flight booked to Strange Loop! 
  They were very professional, and I got to choose a Window for my flight
  to and from. It looks like I am there by 3:30pm on the 27th, and back
  by 6:30pm on the 30th. Have to get my parents something from St. Louis.
  It's easy when you are going back and forth to think casually,
  "Oh, I don't need to get anything..I'll be back". This one..not so much,
  unless I plan to make it to Boston or NY sometime soon (mayyybe).
