## Why are you up at 1am?

## I just got back from my C++ Data Structures Exam.

- I feel great. Really full of energy.
  I actually had a revelation in the middle of the exam.
  Something clicked. 

- I went "ohhhh..." and then my programmes COMPILED. 
  I enjoyed the exam. It was fun! 
  
I heard..not so much for others...

Hahah. I have some colourful friends! 

## A kata
- I also solved this kata:
  Find first x multiples of y:
  eg. mult(3, 4) gives [3, 6, 9, 12]
  
```
function mult(x, y){
  var arr = [];
  for (var i = 1; i <= x; i++)
  {
    arr.push(y * i)
  }
  return(arr);
}
```
