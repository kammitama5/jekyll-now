## Women's Sailing Convention

## I attended my first Women's Sailing Convention at Newport Beach

- It was *amazing!*

## Our Journey
- We left around 10am to head to Long Beach on Thursday. We planned to sail over and spend our night there.
  
- There was fog! We even heard over the radio that they were advising sailors not to come out of the marina,
  because of the fog! With our foghorn in hand, we set sail and eventually got out of the fog.
  There are two types of fog in our area:
  - radiation fog (cold water)
  - convection fog (which usually blows out). Fortunately, we had convection fog, so within 20 minutes, it was clear again!

- Finally, we got to Long Beach! This is the Lighthouse upon entering.

- We had Happy hour and then settled down for the night. Then, we got up, took a shower, and headed out
