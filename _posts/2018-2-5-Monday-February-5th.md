## Women's Sailing Convention

## I attended my first Women's Sailing Convention at Newport Beach

- It was *amazing!*

## Our Journey
- We left around 10am to head to Long Beach on Thursday. We planned to sail over and spend our night there.
  
- There was fog! We even heard over the radio that they were advising sailors not to come out of the marina,
  because of the fog! With our foghorn in hand, we set sail and eventually got out of the fog.
  There are two types of fog in our area:
  - radiation fog (cold water)
  - convection fog (which usually blows out). Fortunately, we had convection fog, so within 20 minutes, it was clear again!

- Finally, we got to Long Beach! This is the Lighthouse upon entering.

- We had Happy hour and then settled down for the night. Then, we got up, took a shower, and headed out

- Long beach is one of the largest ports in the world. I liked this boat because it reminded me of an A-10.
  There is a tug-boat to the left.

## We got to Newport

- Happy hour again! :D
- We met up with friends who also sailed or drove down. People came from as far as Manitoba, Canada, and New
  Jersey to attend.

- I really liked this boat's name :D

## Classes I took
- I took four workshops:
  - Dabble in Diesels
  - Easy Electrical
  - Maintenance Mania
  - Winch Wizard
  
## Dabble in Diesels

<img src="/images/wsc18/w_008.png" width="500">

- So...our boat actually had two issues coming down. We had a temporary fix for one issue, and had to work on another.
- Essentially, our autosteering was slipping and we ended up using some string to tie it off so it would work while we 
  were motoring to our destination. So that wasn't too big of a problem.
- Our boat had some white smoke coming out of the back, which we surmised had something to do with a blocked water pump
  or something in our engine. So that meant when we got to Newport, we'd have to work on it. Sure enough, Holly, who ran
  the Diesel class, was sitting in our boat, along with the Captain, with washers and gaskets and O-rings, taking things 
  apart. 
  
- Ours was not as nice, but we replaced the impeller, which is what lives in that little brass area, surrounded by gaskets

## Easy electrical

- I have worked with some electrical stuff, so a lot of it was review for me. But I though this was funny!
  Judy is amazing! She taught the class, and also teaches Physics and fixes everything on her boat! She is so great,
  she had a special folder with grades of sandpaper all neatly labelled!
  
## Maintenance Mania
- Judy taught this, and she had a plethora of way to keep yourself organized and what to look for and within what 
  time-frame. I heard a story of (in our marina) a couple who failed to maintain their boat and it sank right in the 
  marina.
  
## Winch Wizard
- Firstly, this was our view for this class

<img src="/images/wsc18/w_014.png" width="500">

- I actually signed up for the Spinnaker class, but then thought if I keep racing, I'd learn that, but I wouldn't 
  always have the opportunity to see how to repair and clean the winches. So I opted for that one instead.

- First, we took them apart. Always take them apart and set components in order they were taken apart.

- The inside of the gears, with clips. These are the "click-clicks" you hear when turning the winch!
  Most have two sets; two above and two below (at top and at base of each winch). There is also a spring
  to put it in place with two legs, applying pressure to one leg, while the other sits leaning across
  the side of the winch, and then placing the clip inside its designated spot.
  
- I enjoyed it so much that I actually had a thought of doing a side-business where I offer to clean 
  people's winches over summer or something. I think it would be fun. I also heard someone whisper 
  "Look at how she just took that apart and put it back together so easily!" Ka-ching LOL.
  
  
## Dinner
- We went to our boat and had Happy Hour, and I met the wonderful Leigh, who lives in Mill Valley and 
  sails in Sausalito! She told us about a Diesel Engine class where for eight hours you get to 
  fix a broken Diesel Engine. So a bunch of us were convinced we're going to take the workshop, which
  is in Alameda every quarter :D
  
- I missed the photo-shoot by the flag, but next year (we were busy with our wine, laughing and chatting away).

- We then had dinner: 200 women in one room!

- I ate dessert before I took a photo! :D

## The lady who started it all

- Gail Hine has been sailing from the age of 3, and she is in her 70s today. She is the lady who started the conference,
  and it's been going for 28 years strong. I was amazed on the first night, when she came over to our table, sat
  down and started laughing and drinking wine with the very people I had sailed down with. Everyone is just so nice,
  but also incredibly knowledgeable

- We also had a NASA scientist and sailer speak. She works at Johnson Space Centre and is an avid sailor. She started her 
  own company to manufacture better Anchors, and it has expanded today. She also asked about the people who have been sailing
  the longest, and got one of them to tell their story (coincidentally, the lady sitting next to me, who was British!). Then,
  she asked about the people who recently started sailing, and for whom this is their first sailing conference, and I raised my
  hand and was chosen to speak about my experience. After that, she came over and gave me a bag, a tshirt, a cup holder and thanked
  me for telling my story. 
  
## Raffle
- So they gave us a BUNCH of swag (a bookbag, a mini-anchor ornament, a coupon, a hat, etc)
- After dinner, they raffled off a *lot* of stuff, including a 35 lb anchor, and one lady on our 
  boat won a bag with a fender, a wrench-tool (see photo below), a key-ring, etc. She gave our Captain
  the fender and the tool and gave me the key-ring :D

## So, in all
- A wonderful time! I met so many wonderful people! :D
- I also bought a water-proof vest! I got one of the last, as they ran out!

## I've never been in a place
- I've never been in a place with so many bright, high-achieving women. It was truly a unique and wonderful experience!

- We had so many women (205 in total), they had to close down a men's restroom to accommodate us all :D
