## It's here!

## GUIs
- I'm taking a class for fun on GUIs and how we could re-imagine them if they were influenced by periods in art history.
- I jumped at taking the course because it's the perfect blend of what I like; tech and creativity.
- It's also an excuse to get a Wacom, which I really wanted to get since I had to give the ones I had away when I moved :(

## I took a nap
- I took a nap and got up and saw something at my door this afternoon..it was my Wacom!
- It's unlike the other two that I had owned, so I wasn't sure how it would feel and if I'd get accustomed to it,
  but it's a lot larger than I thought it would be, was super easy to install, and so far, so good!
- I was thinking about getting a tablet, but decided not to get one. I used to draw in a certain store on their tablets,
  and also get kicked out. It's funny that shortly after getting kicked out by their security, they hired me (not as security).
  At the time, I was super broke, and it was a free way of killing time while waiting to visit my friend at NASA (he would take
  me out for dinner and we would sometimes go hang out with other scientists). 
- I definitely made sure to visit the store before I left LA, and I noticed they didn't seem to have any issue with my being there. Ha!
- I haven't been sketching since last summer, and I haven't done any digital painting since around 2016-2017-ish?
- When I was in Silicon Valley, I used to hang out with my buddy on weekends and we would go to places in the area and sketch, even
  though we both were categorized in technical capacities. I miss her! :(
- So maybe in between all the other stuff I'm doing, during quarantine, I'll find time to paint or do some digital sketching. 
- It's a nice thing to do while listening to podcasts or if you just want to clear your head from work.

## Here is my first sketch
- I'm trying a small one in black and white first, and mayyybe I'll move on to colour soon.
