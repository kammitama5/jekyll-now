- It's a really great group; I'm part of the Santa Monica Bay chapter, 
  that usually sails outside of Marina Del Rey.
  
 ## Upcoming

## Apple Valley

- My friend also invited me to an Apple Valley event. If it's fun, I'll post a couple pics :)
- There is talk again of a Category Theory group. If it goes through, I'll def be up for that!
- I'm enjoying C++ class, as well as learning new languages like PureScript. I'm thinking of taking
  Concepts of Programming Languages next semester, in lieu of Discrete Structures. We'll see.
