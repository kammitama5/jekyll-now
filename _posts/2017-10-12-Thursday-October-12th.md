## SCNA and featured in WSA Magazine!

- First up...I received a Grant courtesy [8th Light](https://8thlight.com/) to attend the [SCNA](https://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/), which is a software
  conference that focuses on Craftsmanship. It is a one-day conference of talks, and on the 
  second day, we have a day of a code! I'm really excited and feel quite fortunate to be a part 
  of this event this year!
  
- I'll be sure to document my experience of the event, and of course, my progress/ learning!

## WSA - Santa Monica Bay chapter

- So..we were featured in WSA (Women's Sailing Association)'s magazine for the past race!

- Here I am; photos courtesy WSA

- And here is a photo of us on the boat, holding signs that say "I love WSA"!
  You can see me holding the heart emoji :P

- It's a really great group; I'm part of the [Santa Monica Bay chapter](http://wsasmb.org/), 
  that usually sails outside of Marina Del Rey.
  
## Upcoming
 
 - I am meeting with my JPL-mentor this evening (*update* this was wonderful. We ate dumplings, 
   listened to Jazz and talked about radioisotopes, and then I received the ACM Sigplan 1992 Haskell
   Documentation, with some Fortran scribbled on the back of some pages!) :)
 - Tomorrow, I pack for a day-trip to San Jose, where I'll be attending a Data Science event at Paypal.
 - I'm also finishing up my Nanodegree, which should be done in the next week and a half.
   I may actually do *both* the back-end and Data Science projects. I may choose to do the 
   Back-end for Nov (1st), and the Data Science by mid-Dec deadline. We'll see. I realized they're teaching
   SQL and Vagrant, so I'm hopping right into that. I am having a bit of an issue with vagrant on one 
   machine, but the other one should be better (hopefully will be all set up by end of this weekend).
 - Going on a day-sail on Sunday
 - Working with my classmate on a C++ midterm project
 - Oh, and this upcoming Wednesday is my Midterm exam
 - I'm hoping that once my Nanodegree is completed, I can just focus on C++, and do some Haskell and PureScript (continue)
 - Also, learn a bit of Excel (just the function-related parts)
 
## Apple Valley

- My friend also invited me to an Apple Valley event. If it's fun, I'll post a couple pics :)
- There is talk again of a Category Theory group. If it goes through, I'll def be up for that!
- I'm enjoying C++ class, as well as learning new languages like PureScript. I'm thinking of taking
  Concepts of Programming Languages next semester, in lieu of Discrete Structures. We'll see. 
  
## Katas

- use heron's formula to find area of triangle given a, b, c

```
def heron(a, b, c):
    import math
    s = (a + b + c) / 2 
    area = (s * ((s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)))
    return math.sqrt(area)
```
