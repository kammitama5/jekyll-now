## Long Time no See...updates

## Hey everyone!

- Long time no see :)

- I've been working locally on some stuff.

## Tomorrow...Haskell!

- I'll be going to a Haskell talk on Facebook's GHC Haxl Linker system!
- I'm excited to catch up with friends!
- Oh, and the following day, when I get back, I have an interview for an internship! :)

## Final Project

- We have to do a final project in C++.
  People chose stuff like a refrigerator reminder,
  or something that keeps a tally of inventory for a store.
  I'm making a game and teaching myself [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
  
## Sprite Sheets

- So far, I've made these using [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/).

## UML

- To stay on track, I've also made myself weekly notifications 
  in my calendar as to what I'll accomplish each week. 
  This week, it's mainly completing the Sprite sheet and loading
  them in the game, along with the background. 
  
- I've also created a UML with a basic structure

## Google/ Udacity Developer Challenge

- I've started this today, and am going through the first
  lessons! 
  
- What is quite enjoyable is also seeing in a video Nick,
  who has been such a wonderful, supportive ally throughout 
  my journey. I can't thank the community enough!
  
- I'm actually thinking of (don't tell him! lol) of also sending 
  a little care package at some point to my online mentor, Christian,
  who was really supportive of me when I was doing my Nanodegree.
  He lives in Germany!
  
## Things to do/ upcoming

- Chug along with the game (week one expectations/ plans)
- Go to class tonight! :)
- Continue with Nanodegree
- Attend Haskell Talk in Sunnyvale! 
- Do your best at your interview :)
