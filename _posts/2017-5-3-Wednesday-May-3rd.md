## 5/3/17 - All Lies

## Today I learned:

- Most of what I learned in Mathematics at the earlier levels are all lies or half-truths.

  Learned about pairwise coprimes and Euler's Totient and relative primes. 
  
- [vacuous truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth) - "A vacuous truth is a statement that all members of the empty set
  have a certain property."
  
  One of the things they wanted us to try was a derivation of the Nim game. 
  You can win if you start first and make sure the Nim-sum is zero to win.
  The goal is to be the last person to pick up a number of pencils
  that is either 1, 2 or 3. 
  
  As you can see -> my sweat and tears

  Took me a while to figure it out. First I thought it was just
  keeping the numbers not a multiple of three, 
  then I thought I should just mirror the move of my opponent.
  This is one of those games where it really does have an 
  advantage to start first. See [Impartial games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impartial_game).
