## 5/3/17 - All Lies

## Today I learned:

- Most of what I learned in Mathematics at the earlier levels are all lies or half-truths.

  Learned about pairwise coprimes and Euler's Totient and relative primes. 
  
- [vacuous truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth) - "A vacuous truth is a statement that all members of the empty set
  have a certain property."
