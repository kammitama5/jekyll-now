## 4/17/17 - Post-Easter hangout

## Completed:

- Completed quiz and discussion board for C++. Apparently only four of us did it by the deadline. Yikes. 
  Bear in mind there's an advanced version of this class. I wonder if there will just be two of us in that one! :)
  
- Also all booked for LambdaConf. I'm really excited; this will be my first year attending. 
  The run-down is that I applied on a whim (while secretly hoping) to get a scholarship to attend this year, and I got one, out 
  of five persons chosen. So I was psyched! 
  
## LambdaConf :)

- I really really fit with those programmers and that group more than any other.
  I'm not sure exactly why, but I'm excited to be around FP-ers 24/7 again :)
  I've had a bit of depression since BayHac, and am trying to be more social with non-FP-ers in the dev community, but I can't say 
  I'm enjoying it much. I really like the thought process, the wit and energy of the FP-community, and I've noticed that the only 
  conferences that I seem to really, really enjoy attending are FP-ones. :)

## Things to be done:

- Continue with Lab # 3 and do Homework # 7 (both C++). I'm supposed to be meeting up with my friend, Kevin, either today 
  or tomorrow (or both) so we can work on the lab together. 

- Continue with Programming for Correctness. I'm learning a lot from that. 

## Algo of the morning. 

Here is my solution to a puzzle that was sent my way this morning via our Slack channel.

```
// 1. create a function that takes one parameter
// 2. It must be a string 
// 3. String should be two words 
// 4. Function should return the first letters of both words only
// 5. hint: convert string into an array 

function whatever(x){
 var arr = []
 var a = x.split(" ")
 console.log(a)
 for (var i = 0; i < a.length; i++){
   arr.push(a[i][0])
 }
 console.log(arr)
 return arr
}

whatever("hello world") // returns ['h', 'w']
whatever("Cool Guy") // returns ['C', 'G']

```

## And some LaTeX for my Correctness course.


If you've never seen LaTeX before, this is what it looks like.

It's a really valuable to learn, particularly for preparing papers with scientific or mathematical notation.

## Translation 




And this is what it looks like.

## Things I learned about 

- International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP). Looks interesting. Maybe one year I can attend.
