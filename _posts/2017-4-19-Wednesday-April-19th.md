## 4/19/17 - Summa Time

## Kata solved:

Say hello JS-style

```
var say = function(string1) {
  return function(say){
    return string1 + ' ' + say;
  }
}
// returns 'Hello World!; -> was in format function x()(){}
```

## Personal: 

- Booked a flight to SFO for Google IO today. So relieving because
  I was planning on taking an 8 to 11 hour bus up there. I know that sounds
  pretty crazy to a lot of people, but I guess it's not a big deal to me...
  maybe because I'm not from the US, I think about it as a road-trip.

This was from last year's IO. They had a huge Space Invaders game.
My mom was just confused by my photos from that event.  :)

One of my friends just said casually ....

             <"Oh, so it's like Burning Man for devs".>

 - The only thing that made the situation a bit hairy is that I have class
  on Tuesday night that I definitely cannot miss (the subject matter is too
  important) and I got into JPL's Open House on Saturday morning. 
  So I have a narrow window of time. So a flight is best this time.
  
  I really enjoy the bus trip generally because of the people I meet, 
  the scenery, and just amusement in general. It's a stark contrast
  to the general tech community, which can be a bit of a bubble, 
  although a bubble is nice, sometimes, too. I will say, they treat
  us really, really well at the tech conferences. I can see how after 
  a while, people have come to expect certain things out of them,
  but I never expect anything except good presentations and to meet
  good people and to strengthen my understanding / knowledge. 
  
  Last year, I met a really cool game developer
  named [Robin Hunicke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hunicke),
  who invited me to test out a few of some games she was working on in their 
  San Francisco office with various devices. 
  
  She spoke at IO in 2016. 
  Her company is [Funomena](http://www.funomena.com/).
  That was really fun!
  
## Things to get done:

- Getting started on Homework assignment 6 for C++ today. 
  This is due on the 23rd, the day before my Midterm. 
  
- If I have time, I'll work on my logic course, but we'll see. 

- I also need to rest. Stil have a cough, but getting better.

## Homework done

- This is from my Logic class
