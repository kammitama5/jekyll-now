## A long week

## It's been a long while

- Yup, I know it's been a long while since I posted. I'm not really sure; I guess I was just distracted by learning Haskell.

## So...

- I was laid off from my part time gig on Wednesday, and honestly, it's been one of the best things that has happened to me.
  I felt so relieved, and my parents were cheering for me. I won't go into details, but I'm on embarking on a long journey with a
  bright future, with an uncertain path. I really need to change that song that's playing in the background right now...Axwell ```^```
  Ingrosso's "Dreamer". So appropriate lol.
  
- Anyways, it was kind of funny. My supervisor asked me if I wanted anything, and I said ehh..no. Then I spotted the Python book,
  the Lisp book and the Regular Expressions book on my desk and said "I'll be taking these" LOL.
  
## I spent my first night
- Hanging out with a bunch of JPL scientists. We had fun at the German club, and I met up with a friend who goes to my school there.
  He's a trip, and he has travelled everywhere and has a unique skillset. It was a really fun evening!
  
## And now I'm back in school
- I'm good for a few months, and I'm still going to BayHac (I had already planned for that) and IO (that had been taken care of already).
  I'm also good on bills for the month, so I'm pretty much in school all day using their computers to do Haskell and applying for jobs.
  After ten years of working straight, with only exactly thirteen days without a job (and various degrees of visa pressure and uncertainty), it feels nice to not have that pressure on me as much. Honestly, I'd be happy just working part-time and having my
  bills paid, and doing Haskell. But that's just how I feel for now.
  
- So I installed Stack and am on Monoids. I also worked through the first six problems on ```99 Problems``` in Haskell.

## Solutions

- Find the last element of a list

```
let myLast x = last x
```

- Find the last but one element of a list (basically second to last)

```
let myButLast x = head $ reverse $ init x
```

- Find the kth element of a list

```
let elementAt x y = last $ take y x
```

- Find the number of elements of a list

```
let myLength x = length x
```

- Reverse a list

```

```

- Find out whether a list is a palindrome

```
```
