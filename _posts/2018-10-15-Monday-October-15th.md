## Middle of the Month

## Last week
- Was a super busy one! I managed to do 40 hours of work, visit San Francisco for my GSoC dinner, work with my group
  for the non-profit website, get paperwork together for applying, go to class and do a practice run for my sailing race in November.
- If I can manage, I'll do a picture dump of ICFP photos, chocolate fountains and all that. I didn't stay for the Norvig
  visit (he came to visit us!), as I had to get a flight out of SFO, but it was really worth it going up there and talking to people about
  their experience during GSoC. I also enjoyed meeting a few formal verification peeps who are applying for a PhD this year
  also, and their word of advice, as well as meeting Googlers and hearing their path from being a GSoC student and mentor.
  
## GSoC dinner
- That day was fun because rather than commute around the Bay, I just stayed in a cafe in Nob Hill and did Haskell all day.
  At the moment I'm focusing on data structures, but after this month is complete, and applications are in (probably around
  mid-November), I'll be diving into stuff I need to know for my upcoming internship.
- My friend and I are still doing data structures/ algorithms twice a week during lunch time at work. So I've been trying 
  to transfer my knowledge to Haskell, because some of the data structures are a little bit different in terms of how you
  think about them. I also have the Functional data Structures book.

## Weekend

- Met with our client for the website; she was really insightful and we actually had a few interests in common! I used to 
  help teach kids robotics on my Sundays, and we both had similar goals about education in computer science at the early
  level (her age group is 2 to 8 years in areas that are financially limited). Her company uses Scratch Jr, and when I was
  doing the workshops, we used Scratch and the Mindstorms kits. LA has a huge education (at the lower level) problem at the moment,
  so it was interesting to hear her perspective.
- On Sunday, I went sailing for my race practice. I love sailing! Racing is just awesome. My whole crew is really fun and I 
  had a great time! There was another race going on in Long Beach, so we didn't have one or two other members who will be on
  our boat; they were at that race. I did mostly trim and grinding, but every time I am on the boat, I learn so much!
  I also saw Zenji, Ellison's boat, on the water. I like that when you're sailing, it doesn't matter; you can have your piece 
  of mind, regardless of your social status on land. It's liberating. 

## Anyways
- Trudging ahead with the new week!
