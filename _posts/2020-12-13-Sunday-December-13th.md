## NeurIPS '20: Online version

## This year's NeurIPS was online. 
- My first NeurIPS was in 2019. You can find more about that [here](https://kammitama5.github.io/Saturday-December-14th/). At the time,
  I felt coming in like I was pretty much an outsider (I was the only person there from my school), and had just gotten lucky or someone had
  accidentally decided to grant me a travel award to attend. It was also my first time in Canada, and having a love for the West Coast, it gave
  me a reason to visit. Also, having my first semester turn out pretty terribly and feeling isolated, I was pretty much looking for any reason to get away.
  
## This year
- A lot has happened in a year. I've settled in a lot more, and even though I am still an outsider in many ways where I am, in terms of the Academic community, 
  I would say that I've quite settled in. I'm pretty familiar with many people in the AI research community, and consider them my peers and friends. They 
  have talks with me and send me texts, tell me about their papers, and mentor me. We're there for each other, even as they are in Academic institutions scattered
  all over the world.
- So by the time this summer rolled around, I was notified that I was chosen for both the organizational team of WiML and BAI. To be honest,
  it was unexpected. I was pretty sure that one would reject me, so I was pleasantly surprised to be accepted by both organizations. This
  year would be a challenge; everyone was adapting to the virtual platform. We had to be creative and try to keep people engaged.
  
## Schedules changing
- We ended up planning a number of activities and how they would translate to being virtual, such as the mentorship roundtables. 
  Each organization did them in a unique way. We had virtual sponsor booths. We had ways for participants to mingle and all the talks 
  would now be online. This meant that we had multiple platforms, and that some talks would be pre-recorded and others would be live.
  We ended up using a mix of SlidesLive, Gather Town, Zoom, Rocket Chat and the NeurIPS website.
  
## On top of that
- I discovered this year that two of my submissions (in fact, the only two I had submitted) were accepted to workshops at NeurIPS!
  That was exciting. For one I was a first author (in fact, the sole author), and for the other, I was second author. So that was pretty
  cool! I'm quite pleased that I went from entering this new world just a year ago to being so engaged! Finally, I moderated two Q&As for
  WiML; one with Mihaela and another with Rediet, and fed questions for the other Q&As. I also moderated a talk with Cyril for BAI, and the
  topic was completely up my alley! AI and art! So cool!
  
## One of the treats
- One of the treats this year was also being able to attend for the first time, [SOCML](https://www.socml.org/). I was one of nine to attend
  the privacy track, and invited by Ian himself, which was a surprise. The discussion was fantastic, and being a secure computation nut this 
  semester, I was able to listen in and ask a question about it, too! As it turns out, I'll be continuing to spend my time this winter break
  (classes start again in February) on encryption and NLP. Also, I signed up for two classes that start in January and that run for 3 to 6 
  weeks. I'm excited about those as well. Finally, I got into two workshops; one based in the UK, and the other based in the US, and I'll
  be attending those in January. I'm also waiting back to hear from some other stuff.

## Aftermath
- This is a small fraction; I don't want to point out specific people as I respect people's privacy, but some people mentioned or tagged
  me and I ended up getting flooded with LinkedIn requests. So I'm making my way through that. I also went to a few recruitment sessions,
  and missed one by an hour (sorry!). 
- However, I had a great time, met incredible people, had great conversations, learned a lot and got really involved in the community this
  year, all from the comfort of my space. So that was pretty cool. The workshops were at different timezones, though, I definitely took
  power naps in between, and some things messed up my sleep schedule.
