## RustReach First Meeting

## Finally back in LA

- I got back into LA last night around 11pm. Got to sleep around 2am.
- I knocked out and got up around 10am. I don't think I've slept that 
  long in a while. It was a bit nice, but really weirded me out when I saw
  the time.
  
## At 1pm
- Okay, so I had *no* idea that Slack had video conferencing as an option. Wut?
- I have two main laptops; one is for working (Linux) and the other is 
  for general personal stuff (Windows). The other personal stuff is 
  capable of running things like Cloud9 if I need a linux console for a workshop
  and I don't need that much space (say, a one-day workshop that isn't Android
  or something). However, it has limited space. So if I have Slack and am watching
  listening to music in the background and writing emails, the browser might crash.
- So yeah..that's interesting. However, it forces me to streamline the chatter in 
  my life, and just focus on work, which is good. So one thing at a time, and 
  I don't get distracted once I've sat down to work. 
- Anyways, I met with Aaron, and he was quite wonderful. My task for this week
  is to go through the ```cargo book```.
  You can find it [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/faq.html).
  I was able to complete that today, but I found the list of Rust's Compiler Errors
  [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html). So I'll be reading that 
  until the wee hours of the morning. 
- The Rust community is pretty great. I've interacted with them before. No complaints.

## Tomorrow
- I'm working on CodeWorld, because today was also a bit of my day of rest (see the AM
  sleep-out). I was able to work out my schedule so that I spend around (on average)
  53 hours on CodeWorld a week (not including meetings online with my mentors).
  
## I'm also really excited
- To spend part of this summer working on Racket. I really think it will make me a stronger
  programmer. I really appreciated that after I signed up, one of the actual professors
  wrote us a personal email. Really nice touch. I'm particularly looking for sort 
  of interaction in a PhD programme. I don't do well at places with hundreds of people.
  I get really burnt out. So I think my mentor guided me to make the best choice.

## This week
- Is my last real week of sort of goofing off before my mentor can officially kill me.
  I can still manage to put in the time for this week (around 40 hours), but from next week,
  I'm officially GSoC's and Mozilla's. I won't reveal much but there will be a fair amount 
  of fun this week, and I'll be sure to take pics (if I can) and post about it!
  
## And that's it for now!
