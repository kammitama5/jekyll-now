## GSoC Day 55 and Helium Grant!

## So I can finally say it
- I received a [Helium Grant](https://www.heliumgrant.org/) this week! I've been in touch with 
  Nadia Eghbal since Wednesday keeping it under wraps (but of course, sharing with with my parents,
  my brother and our dog :D The very next day, I found out I had also received a ticket to RustConf!
  I mean..pretty exciting! :D
- Back in April when I applied (it wasn't that long ago, but feels like it's been a long journey
  since then!), I had two barely functioning computers. I was thinking of duct-taping a camera
  to one so that I had something close to screen-sharing. A week or two later Chris, my mentor,
  decided to purchase me a laptop. I'm really grateful for this.
- However, I *never* expected to receive the Helium Grant! I was in the middle of my part-time
  testing gig, and went downstairs during my half-hour break, and checked my email (by being a bum
  and just using the coffee shop's wifi; they know me and I *do* buy a bagel from time to time,
  so I am not *too* much of a leech of their wifi lol). The email surprised me.
- I felt conflicted because I did have a laptop, even though I was having issues getting it to screen-share.
  This was before I did a clean re-install and worked out my current situation, which is workable.
- So I asked Gabe what I should do. This is where the "dad-advice" came in. He gave me really solid advice,
  which I used to proceed. I wanted to be honest about my situation to Nadia. Where I'm from, honesty is a
  big thing. He basically said to be honest and let her decide.
- She got back to me the next morning and told me I was chosen because of the significant challenges I had
  overcome, my motivation and because I was doing something really interesting with my life. Out of 700 people,
  11 people were chosen. And I was one of them. I still can't believe it. I'm super grateful.
  
## This has been a long journey
 - And I could have never imagined I would have had such immense support. It means a lot to me. 
   This has been the *winding* path for sure, and a few years ago I would have never imagined that this would be
   my life. But it's been *really* rewarding; much more than I could have ever imagined. There have been ups and downs
   but I'm really excited about my trajectory.
   
## Anyways
 - I have some Elm to do today. I'm focusing on understanding how the debugger works. So I may make some notes on
   this as I understand it tonight. 
## Update
 - So I didn't *actually* get around to doing the Elm earlier in the day I tried to wake my laptop
   up from sleeping, and it actually didn't wake up :O
 - As it turns out, my screen went kaput, so I could see it dimly flickering. So working on getting that repaired,
   but in the meantime I got a Lenovo Laptop. It has a more powerful core and is already faster; however
   Chromium is not working on 18.04 in a stable manner. There have been several complaints.
   So I opted for Opera instead, and I *love* it. It's fast. It also works flawlessly with GHangouts, which
   is what we use for our screen-sharing. I also got a new headset, which is more
   like the one I use at work. It also works quite well. Henry II (this new laptop) has
   space, Deep Spec, LambdaConf and Coq stickers :D However, he really needs a Haskell sticker :(
   
 ## Elm
  - So I believe our slider will be something along the lines of [this](http://debug.elm-lang.org/edit/Stamps.elm).
    Here it keeps in memory a list of the mouse positions and their click locations. The slider tracks when they occurred,
    and we can go back in time to a state in time in which the clicks were applied.
  - Apparently, the debugger was inspired by [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII)
