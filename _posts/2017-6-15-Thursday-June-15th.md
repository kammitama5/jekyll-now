## Data Model, C++ Resources going forward etc

## Great advice

- I got some *great* advice from the people on functional Slack.
  C++ is such a great language, and it's challenging,
  but there is also a lot of stuff that differs from industry,
  and *that's* frustrating.

- I also got a list of good resources :

## Resources : 

[Gaming Patterns Book](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)

[Stack Overflow C++ Book Guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list)

- Good Youtube C++ tutorial stuff

## Kata Solved 

- Find number couple with greatest difference.
  Given in form of an array such as :

```diff(["1-11", "2-3"]) 
# should return "1-11"

diff(["3-3", "4-4"])

# should return False 
either if array is empty
or if the difference is 0
```

## Solution: 

```
def diff(arr):
  arr1 = []
  
  ## find absolute difference
  
  for i in arr:
    arr1.append(abs(eval(i)))
    
  ## check that array is not empty, else return False  
  if len(arr) == 0:
      return False
      
  ## Find max difference index in original array
  else:
      b = (max(arr1)) 
      
      if b != 0:
        c = arr1.index(b)
        return arr[c]
      else:
        return False
```


## Another 

- If number of lowercase > uppercase,
  switch entire string to lowercase,
  else uppercase entire string 

## Solution 

```
def case_unification(n):
    l = 0
    u = 0
    
    for i in n:
      if i == i.lower():
        l = l + 1 
      elif i == i.upper():
        u = u + 1 
        
    if l > u:
      return n.lower()
    else:
      return n.upper()
```
