## A Cloudy Day

## So...

- I missed the last day of my workshop to stay up from 
  4am to 1:30am the next day doing a course that was
  supposed to take one week to complete...and I did it 
  in one day!
  
## Um...

- See, I was given this coupon, and it gave me access to
  the class for free, and the training is super important
  for me, but I had to complete it by July 2nd.
  
- Since I start a *new* workshop which may have a heavy
  workload, in addition to the Udacity Nanodegree,
  I *had* to make sure I got it done before I started
  my workshop today.
