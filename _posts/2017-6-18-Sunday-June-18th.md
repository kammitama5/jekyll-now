## Happy Father's Day!

## Working on my NanoDegree

- So far, so good. 
  I just submitted my first assignment, which will not be graded, 
  but will receive feed back.
  
- I also have a mentor, who is really nice.
 
- It's well-structured in that it tells you
  when you've submitted, and that within 24 hours you'll get a review.
  This means that I need to do the assignment early, so I'm not
  standing around by the deadline wondering if it will be approved or not.
  
## A first simple website

- Yes, let's forget that I've been doing Firebase and a bunch
  of other crazy stuff, and starting another workshop on Sundays.
  Everything helps, no matter how trivial. 

## I added a favicon :)

- This one is aptly called the "anti-favicon".

## And a background, even though we didn't *have* to

## And some images (this was required)

![ud_003](/images/ud_003.png)

## And learned how to add code (I already know how to do this in .md format)

## I made some bullet points (also not required)

## And here's the code for adding code snippets (thanks, SO)

- I used the <xmp> tag

## I missed out a rad party

- A couple people from my C++ Data structures class had a beer pong
  thing last night.
  I don't drink, but I *know* because they're all computer geeks,
  it would have probably included some great gaming.
  
- I ended up watching a bunch of documentaries on the NRO,
  which manufactures, monitors and deploys aircraft and satellites for 
  government surveillance
  
- A bunch of NRO's documentary footage is still classified, 
  so about a third of their stuff is *readacted*
  
- I also watched a couple ICBM documentaries.
  ICBM meaning [Inter-continental ballistic missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile), btw.
  
## Things I'd like to do

- Visit Seattle

- Visit the Museum of Flight museum,
  which has a [Blackbird](http://www.museumofflight.org/Exhibits/blackbird).
  Wicked sick, huh?
