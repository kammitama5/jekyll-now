## Exam tomorrow

- I totally have an Exam tomorrow,
  but playing with Firebase is more fun!
  
## Codelabs has some neat stuff

- Playing around with their tutorial stuff.
  Here is this App thing they start you off with 
  to learn to use Firebase and their AI.api.
  
- There are a couple things...it isn't really
  conducive to using a Cloud-based service
  (which I like doing because my current laptops
  have little to no storage, and it's good to 
  just delete virtual environments and start afresh
  sometimes.
  
  That being said, the FireBase tools themselves
  via the command line were a piece of cake to install
  in a virtual environment. Locally (depending on your 
  OS, not so much). 
  
- And..not very intuitive sometimes...
  Everything looks like text, so it isn't always obvious
  *where* you shoud enter fields
  (ie where you *can* input text or values, vs where you can't)
  Still very fun, though.

## And then...I broke it :(

## Local set-up

- So I tried to do this again on a local 
  environment.
  
- So far, so good, but then when I wanted to
  authenticate the Firetools login,
  it said that there was an error
  and that I needed to use login:ci 
  
- Turns out, using Powershell instead of 
  Git overrides this. 
  
## So..success!

## Homework, etc

- I have to review Linked Lists for my exam tomorrow,
  so going to do that.
  
- I also have an Assignment to do in JS,
  so there's that, too, but this was a fun experiment.
  As I become more comfortable with the pipeline,
  hopefully I can do some more interesting stuff
  and help others trouble-shoot in our workshop, etc.
