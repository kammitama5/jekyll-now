## Data and Retrospective

## Hey everyone! 

- As this year comes to a close, I'd like to do a little retrospective.

## But first....I've been learning Pandas!

- It's been *really* enjoyable! 
- They even use stuff like tail, which is used in FP. 

## Reading in files and filling in missing data (my solutions)

## Checking for duplicate data and placing the mean value instead

- verify by checking duplicates before and after

## Data Visualization

## Using a Scatterplot to explore relationships between two values/ columns

## Plotting historgrams

## Looking at the data and its shape/ description

## Getting the last row of the data

## Getting the last three rows of data

- A lot of this feels like dealing with a database, which is really fun!

## Next up, we're going to be doing some case studies...

- And then I have a few projects to complete. 
  I'm doing a mini-course on just Python Analysis, and also doing
  the Nanodegree. 
- I'm really enjoying both.
- It reminds me of Databases, R, Functional programming, 
  LaTeX, Matlab, Mathematica, all in one *humble bundle* (see what I did there? :D)
  
  
## Things upcoming
- Finish Data Analysis final two projects on shorter course
- Go through last two lessons, Cast Studies and Projects on Nanodegree Analysis
- Finish application for a possible internship
- Prepare for interview on Monday (I'm on round 2..passed initial HR coding challenge!)

## And now..a Retrospective

- I've been musing about this for a few days...
  in between watching Cuphead gameplay (I looooooooooove Cuphead!!!!)

## Things I'm grateful for in 2017
- MY GREEN CARD *kisses card for the umpteenth time*
- all of the opportunities, interviews and scholarships and general support from the tech community.
  Seriously; I've never felt so much support and so much like this is what I'm supposed to do with 
  my life, and I'm incredibly grateful. Thank you for giving me a chance and for not giving up on me.

## Things I want to want holistically
- To get better. I really want to be a *good* programmer. I work at it *every* day, 
  but I'd like to be better. 
- My three languages of choice: Python, Haskell, C++.
- A solid gig. Now that I have my green card, I'm looking around for the right fit for me. 
  Pretty much anywhere in the Galaxy. I'm taking my time as I don't have the visa stress that I did
  up to a few months ago.
- I want a year's worth of savings. I live like a minimalist (I have no debt)
  and am really quite bad at taking care of myself with respect to the "buying new clothes" stuff. 
  I'm wearing shoes with holes as I type this. However, I don't have any debt and I have a fair
  amount of cash saved up. My goal is to have a year's worth that is liquid
  (so I'm not counting my current Investments, which I don't touch, in any case). Frugality and 
  minimalism = Freedom to me
  
## Things I'd like to learn/ continue learning/ improve in 2018
- I'd like to write better code in general, but specifically continue on a path  
  of good, clean, readable code. 
- I need to get better at documenting and naming, and algorithms and data structures
- I need to get better at problem-solving in general. I have to dig into Hackerrank more,
  as I've had about at least four interviews so far that have used them. I'm getting better
  at them, thankfully, but instead of CodeWars (I'm a huge fan of that platform and in top 500),
  I should be focusing on Hackerrank, because it is easier for me to train in a specific language
  for days on end, instead of deciding "this problem is easier to solve in X language", and hopping
  from language to language that has specific advantages over others. 
- Oh, I'd like to continue side-hustles in general, and applying for things in general. 
  I don't ever want to get lazy or complacent.
  
## So hopefully

- In the New Year, you'll be seeing a steady stream of Python, Haskell and some C++.
  The C++ is for algorithmic understanding. The Python is the general language I'd 
  like to train on (best for testing), but also Haskell (because I like it and the community, 
  but I think it will take me longer to get better at writing code in Haskell). PureScript is in
  there somewhere; I don't think I'll be writing as much, but I would like to keep up with the group,
  as it does strengthen my Haskell and thinking in general, and I love that community, also.
