## A Day with Julia

## Scientific Computing
- I spent the day learning some Julia.

- This is the downloaded version. I also am running one 
  on Jupyter (see images below). So far, so good.

## I got up to Functions and reading in and plotting data
- Here are two ways of writing functions:

- one-liner

- Ruby-esque :D

## Upcoming
- Tonight, I'm probably going to work on finishing up Week 2's assignments,
  as I can run it on [JuliaBox](http://www.juliabox.org/).
  Seriously, though, these Cloud IDEs/ applications are saving my life!
- During the weekend, I'm going to work on my Data Science Project 1 project
- During the week, I'm going to finish up some Advanced SQL
- Sparklecon is next Saturday, but I'll have Sunday to work on Project 2

## I really
- Don't want to attend a boot camp or anything, because they just teach web stuff.
  I'm also aware that if I join one, I'll probably be around peers who will be 
  interested in things like syntax, and not necessarily be able to interact with 
  people who are interested in other more niche aspects of programming and programming
  languages. 
- But if I have to, I definitely want to do one that stick with Python, because 
  at least I can have the benefit of playing around with Data Analysis on my own.
- I'm interested in correctness and languages that have succinct syntax and type-checking,
  clean code. I'd like to continue with that.
- I'm exploring the possibility of working for a year and then using that year to build up 
  savings, while applying for my Master's. I'm honestly not that fascinated by building 
  CRUD applications. The correctness and debugging applications and type theory are really
  fascinating, and I'd beat myself over the head if I didn't spend the time (now that I have it)
  to study some of that stuff. Some people never get to, and I have a window of opportunity (I think?).
- I've spoken to experienced developers lately, who are increasingly dissatisfied with the quality 
  of work that is being put out. At companies big and small, they're frustrated because people just
  *don't care*. So I have a sense of what I'm stepping into, and I'm aware of an environment where
  I will probably be looked down upon because I don't have the experience, *plus* being told that
  things like correctness *don't matter* because it's all about shipping a project. So that's something
  to think about. 

## That's pretty much it for now.
