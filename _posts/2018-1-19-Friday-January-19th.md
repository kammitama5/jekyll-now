## A Day with Julia

## Scientific Computing
- I spent the day learning some Julia.

- This is the downloaded version. I also am running one 
  on Jupyter (see images below). So far, so good.

## I got up to Functions and reading in and plotting data
- Here are two ways of writing functions:

- one-liner

- Ruby-esque :D

## Upcoming
- Tonight, I'm probably going to work on finishing up Week 2's assignments,
  as I can run it on JuliaBox.
- During the weekend, I'm going to work on my Data Science Project 1 project
- During the week, I'm going to finish up some Advanced SQL
- Sparklecon is next Saturday, but I'll have Sunday to work on Project 2

## That's pretty much it for now.
