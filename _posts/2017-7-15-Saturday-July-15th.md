## Spinnaker and a beautiful day of sailing!

- My my, this is quickly becoming a sailing and coding blog! 

- But they do intersect, don't they? Just a while ago I was talking about 
  Netflix's Spinnaker, and today I put one up! :)
  
- It was actually a Gennaker, but it was a wonderful day!

## We saw dolphins! 

- We sailed all the way to Malibu and back.

- We even saw this guy!

## I have to get up early in the morning...

- Got to get started on my labs. 
  If not, I'll do them in LA; I should have 
  access to them then, too. But I'd like to get
  them done this weekend
  
## In the meantime...

- Our beautiful Gennaker/ A-sail!

- Sum the strings

```
function sumStr(a,b) {
  if ((a  == null) || (b == null))
  {
    return "0"
  }
  else if ((a == "") && (b == "")){
    return "0"
  }
  else if ((a == null) || (a == "")){
    return b
  }
  else if ((b == null) || (b == "")){
    return a
  }
  else{
    return (parseInt(a) + parseInt(b)).toString();
  }
}
```
