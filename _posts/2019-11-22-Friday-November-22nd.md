## Trip to Boston (for the first time)

## The weekend before Thanksgiving
- I made a trip to Boston because of an AI group I'm in. Specifically, they wanted me to take part
  in an interview for a group that encourages young women to study in areas like STEM. So I obliged,
  also deciding that it would be a good way for me to meet some AI researcher friends, and get some
  Caribbean food, since Vermont is lacking in the Caribbean food department.
- It ended up being an adventure!

## Made it to a few places
- I made it to CSAIL, because I decided that that was one of the places I had to visit. 
  But some dude was incredibly rude to me (Boston is not known for kindness!), and I asked someone
  where the nearest exit was so I could just get the heck out of CSAIL. So she apologized and 
  showed me where I could go. I was frustrated because I did not look like someone who *belonged* there,
  so he started to interrogate me, which was *awful*. Then I spoke up, and he left me alone. But the 
  damage had been done, and I was really angry about it. I just wanted out. I decided I was going to
  do the interview and just go straight back to my hotel. Academia is not welcoming to people like myself.
- On the way out, I really had to use the restroom, because my next stop was about 15 minutes of walking.
  So I asked someone, and they pointed me in the direction of some stairs. As I was coming down the stairs,
  I saw Erik D., who I recognized from YouTube, and he humbly said "thanks for watching my videos", and took
  a photo with me. So that made me feel a bit better.
  
## I then walked over to my interview
- It went really well, and I made a few friends from the Media Lab who had a robot named Jibo. They invited me
  to their lab for tea, so I finished up my interview, and then headed over to their lab. They were really 
  wonderful and made everything worthwhile. I left their lab after getting a mini-tour, and having made a few friends.
  Of course, since it's a research lab, I definitely can't show anything from there. And I probably won't say anything
  if you ask me, either.
  
## Then I went for roti
- I was told that there was roti and Caribbean food in general in Boston, so I decided to go find some. It did not
  disappoint. I bought *a lot* of Caribbean food, and left happy. I have to figure out how to pack all of it, but
  where there is a will...
  
## I'm really grateful for today
- It turned out much better than I anticipated, and I'm thankful for new friends, even though I am ready to head
  back to Vermont (with my food lol). I'm spending Thanksgiving week in the lab, and also going to a Faculty member's
  house in the evening on the day of Thanksgiving. So we'll see how that goes.
