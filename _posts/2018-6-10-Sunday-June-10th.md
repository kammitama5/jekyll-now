## GSoC, RustReach Day 28 and Disappointment

## I'm currently going through
- The 2nd day of the [ZuriHac Haskell Beginner Session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fNIhrDhaYA).
- Day 1 was pretty easy for me, but I'm definitely reaching a bit of a ceiling for day two.
- Once I start getting into composition and Monads, I start to feel like I'm hitting a wall.
  I don't have enough experience nor understand a lot of that stuff, even though I understand
  *some bits* conceptually.

## Also
- I'm moving on with a new part of my GSoC project, and I'm not quite sure how to start.
  So there's trepidation about that.
- I also have to attend a final tomorrow, and asked three different people if it's tomorrow,
  and haven't heard back from anyone yet. Not even the teacher. I *hate* this.
- Also, I'm trying to confirm that I have a place to stay next week, and I've heard nothing about
  that yet.
- Finally, I reached out to a person who said they wanted help with an open source project, and 
  haven't heard back from them.
- So pretty much frustration all around. I guess part of it is my impatience and frustration that
  a lot of things are just *out of my control*. That stresses me out a bit.
  
## Otherwise
- I guess I just have to keep pushing. I really do like Haskell, and Rust has been treating me well, also.
- My plan is to work on Rust in the early mornings, and Haskell in the evenings and early mornings. So that's
  pretty doable.
- Everything is just difficult right now, and it's a bit frustrating. I have these doubts..like, what if I never
  get good at Haskell? What if no one wants to give me a break in the open source world after these projects?
  What if I've reached the limits of things I *can* do in Haskell, and it becomes gibberish after a certain plateau?
  Of course this is all silly, because *lots* of people have learned Haskell, and certainly the Rust community is
  super kind and friendly, so I won't be cut off from Open source as long as I'd like to contribute, but there's
  always that fear. 
- I'm hoping to get into J's Haskell book group, and stick with the Utah Online group. I wasn't able to make the last
  session of the Utah Haskell group; I can't remember why not (I was probably somewhere where I didn't have internet
  access), but I plan to stick with both and get as much support as I can learning. It's definitely not something you'd
  want to give a go by yourself, because you *do* get stuck. You do need that support when you're learning a language. It's
  super important, and also it's important to know that people are rooting for you.
  
## Anyways, I Guess that's it for today
- Sorry it's not a super-cheery post or anything. I hope I didn't depress anyone LOL. But I try to keep it real and 
  the truth is not every day is a Captain-Planet-saves-the-world kind of day, you know? Maybe this week will be better!
