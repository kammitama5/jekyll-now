## The **Best** Times!

## I'm really sorry
- But **this** is the best title! This is exactly how I feel!
- I'm having the **time** of my life just writing and learning Haskell all day. 
- If I could do this for the rest of my life, I'd be pretty happy (*Haskell cue sugar daddy*)(just kidding!)
- I LOVE THIS!!!!!! I'm seriously HAPPY every day and excited to come to the lab and just code for 8 or 9 hours straight, with my
  headphones on, and a flask of tea that lasts me all day. I also started packing a sandwich, which works when my stomach starts grumbling  for a morsel of bread.

## But seriously
- Today I came in to the School library at 8am (I actually got in at 7 and slept for an hour, because they open at 8), and this guy asked me how long I was going to be there because he was briefly stepping away, and I said "until 5pm". He was in shock. But yup. Time just
goes by learning Haskell. I can't even explain it! It's like chatting with a good friend...who yells at you and curses at you for making mistakes! :D

## Oh
- I've heard back from a few companies, so I'm doing some coding tests. 
- Yes, I've gotten some rejections, too, but I don't focus on that. 
- This has given me so much hope that I *can* become a developer! That's **so** cool! :D
- Maybe...just maybe...I can write Haskell for a living and for food, too! (and not for **dog** food) :D
- Haskell all day, errr day! :D

## So..
- I'm going to a PureScript meetup tonight. 
- So I'll post notes of things I've learned.

## PureScript notes...
