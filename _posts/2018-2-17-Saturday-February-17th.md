## A Interface-ing

## Just a short Break
- I'm on Chapter 13 out of 15 on Compilers! I should be done by tomorrow or Monday latest!
- I'm also going to start reading Kleene's "Mathematical Logic" book in the evenings.
- Once the week starts (ie Tuesday), it's back into my Nanodegree (Data Science).
- I hope I can also get some of the paper I have to read in this weekend, but that depends. 

## Spent today
- Today, I visited my Hackerspace and learned a bit about PyQt. So, since there is a long weekend,
  I thought it a perfect opportunity to build something. I have two projects in mind.
  - The first is a Node-based interface that would allow you to build and connect nodes.
    This is a bit steeper for me I'm thinking, so I'll do them linearly first. I'd like it to eventually
    count the number of nodes and make connections between them, etc
  - An Assembly calculator. Something that allows you to add, subtract, store and load values, and will
    give you the result. I can get started on this over the weekend with my limited Qt knowledge from today.
    I actually don't know Assembly, but I know a teeny, tiny bit from playing around with NASM and from my 
    Compiler course.

## And...
- I'm still pretty busy, and there are some things that are up in the air, but pressing on.
- I missed a friend's stream (in Haskell) *three times*. However, I've watched all of the streams afterwards on 
  my own time. 

## I also
- Got word that I've been accepted to this year's International Women's Day celebration at Google LA. So that should 
  be pretty fun! It's on a Saturday, too, right in the middle of my volunteering for SCALE! :D
- Oh yeah, and I applied for another thing over summer and there is this thing that may totally wreck the plans of 
  a bunch of other stuff, but I'll find out by this week if it will or not :D. Oh well...life!
  
## And..that's all I've got!
