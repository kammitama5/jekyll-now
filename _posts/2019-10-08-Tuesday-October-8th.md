## Taking time to acknowledge everything

## I just completed a Meeting
- I've been poking around the Internet to see what PhD profiles can and do look like. 
  It occurred to me after a one and a half hour long weekend that I haven't taken the time to acknowledge 
  some of the stuff I've done this year.
  
- PhDs do that, I guess, so maybe I should too?
  
## Lately

  (That's been my Tuesday evenings, even though we are also on Whatsapp and communicate pretty
  frequently for scheduling meetings, etc. We also use Trello, etc) [ July to present ]
- I started attending meetings on Wednesdays for my school's research project [ Sept to present ] 
- I started TA-ing a Matlab class, with office hours and TA hours pretty much on Thursdays. It's been a mix
  of showing up to two classes back to back, holding 2 hours of office hours and grading assignments. [ Sept to present ]
- I gave a presentation for my summer group's research project in my first week of attending classes for our CS Research Day. The audience included faculty from
  our department and the Department Chair (how about that for your first week!) [ Sept ] 
- I gave another talk a week and a half later to our local CS Club on Google Summer of Code and Internships [ Sept ]
- I am giving another (shorter) talk this Wednesday for our CS Club on Open Source projects involving Mathematics [ Oct]
- I am attending the Google Developer Student Lead Summit in Sunnyvale (all expenses paid by Google) [ Oct ]
- I am giving another talk to a senior class on Interviewing, Job-hunting, Finances (basically life advice) [ Oct ] 
- I received an Opportunity to attend both Twitter's MLFlock events for PhD ML students in Boston and New York; 
  I will be attending the [event in New York City](https://mlflocktalkny2019.splashthat.com/) on Academia to Industry and Twitter technology.
- I received a travel grant through the NSF to attend Sage Days, which is about contributing to SageMath,
  open source software for Computational Maths [ Nov ]
- I received complimentary registration and a travel grant to attend Neurips! [ Dec ]

## Current Classes
- Software Verification (295A) (FA19)
- Data Privacy (295B) (FA19)
- Human Computer Interaction (228) (FA19)

## Anticipated Classes
- Evolutionary Robotics (SP20)
- Machine Learning (SP20)

## I think this means I'm not doing *too* badly in my first semester

- I keep pushing myself, though. It's been fun. I've really been enjoying research, my classes, and being a PhD student.
  I can't imagine really doing anything else right now. I haven't decided quite yet if I am going to do a summer internship
  next year, but I've been applying and interviewing, so we'll see how it all turns out. Either way, I can just stay over
  the summer and do research, too, so it depends. 
  
- There are many; so many more things in the works right now, but I should get to sleep. But I feel a bit better; it's been
  a wild ride!
- I tend to look ahead and think of all the things I *want* to accomplish, which can distract from the things I have accomplished. What a list!
  
## And that's about it
