## Adventures in Block World

## Sometimes I go back and forth
- Sometimes, I go back and forth about whether I really am an engineer. It reminded me of a panel I moderated last year,
  where I accidentally referred to the speaker as Professor, and he said "I'm not a professor; I'm a hacker" in a thick French accent.
- Yes, a hacker, that's more like it.
- I was discussing with a friend that I was speaking with someone who wanted to pursue grad school, and who had come from a liberal 
  arts background, like myself. One of the things I told him was that he is the perfect person for research. I was telling my friend that the liberal 
  arts people who transition to technical fields are perfect for *creative* problem solving, because their minds are spared from the boxing that inevitably
  comes with too much of a STEM education, too early. Let me explain.
- STEM training, at the lower level, is essentially training to be an employee. Many of the persons I met later in life who were interested in engineering 
  or science told me that they, too, were either hackers, became electrical engineers or roboticists out of tinkering with amps and modding them in high school,
  and many other wonderful and delightful stories. Some of them worked behind the scenes in theatre, dressed in black, or behind video cameras at their local station in high school. Some loved anime and wanted to work in animation. There was an element of play that led them to their passion.
  
## This permeates into culture
- In my first grad school semester, someone told me that I couldn't possibly know anything about a thing because it wasn't my specialization. It was the first time in a long time I had been confronted again with the "you can't possibly know this" mindset. This is an example of the
  training and the mindset that is a result of not encouraging creative problem-solving, or an openness to solve complex problems. I've been thinking deeply
  about this, and wonder why I often don't believe in this ideology. I've come up with a few explanations
- I moved away from this in undergrad, deliberately choosing a field that was based on an expectation of being both technical and creative. I also came from a 
  region where we are not given the privilege of the expectation of just doing *one* thing. Often, someone sees a need or a skillset that is lacking, learns as 
  best they can, and gives it a shot. When I worked in the video industry in my country of birth, there was no such thing as a "set electrician". They hired 
  someone who was an actual electrician, figuring out that he already liked the job and since it was a budding new industry, they might as well give him a shot
  (he was more than qualified anyways). Additionally, I stuck to fields that encouraged that kind of openness; the kind of field where someone would need help, 
  pull you aside and say "hey kid, I'm going to teach you how to fix this thing. Watch me first and then you try it." I had similar experiences in sailing. There
  wasn't "you don't have the experience" or "you're not the expert don't touch anything". It was more "this needs to get done; let's give you a shot". 
  
 ## I've been wandering through a new world
 - I've currently been involved in a few new ventures, where I'm often the only person like myself. But I'm of the belief that the culture of the community, if
   it's good, is enough to hold me. When I'm into a thing, it doesn't matter if I know nothing about it, or if I stick out; if they are happy to have me and someone
   is willing to take the time and has the patience to teach me, I'll eventually stick around long enough to learn a thing. Heck, I may even become incredibly 
   engrossed in the thing and become really good at it. So that's what it feels like right now. It overlaps a lot with my research, and it definitely seems like
   the direction I'd like to go, so I'm sticking with it.
 - I've been up at really early hours in the morning, on Discord servers, and have made so many new friends. We're all misfits, but we are among friends. 
   We are curious to bring with us bits of who we are to this new world, where there are no rules besides sharing knowledge, learning, and giving back to our community.
   We are escaping block land, the place that tells us "we can't", because we lack some arbitrary privilege. 
 - One of the things I loved when I first moved to California was that the lines were a lot more arbitrary. You never knew where you could end up. A friend of mine
   started out after a music degree, falling in love with rockets, and went back to school for physics. We met at a workshop at NASA, and he changed his major to 
   electrical engineering, and today he continues to work on that stuff, at a startup in the Bay area. What if someone had told him along the way that he lacked
   some arbitrary privilege? 
 - I think people figure it out along the way, so I don't think it's my place to tell someone, if they feel like at this time, at this moment, this is where they
   should be. It's funny considering that tech talks about people like Jobs all the time, but dismiss that he found himself, arbitrarily, taking a calligraphy class.
   Yet, a lot of these fields still put people in boxes, dictating what they can and cannot do based on a piece of paper or an input in a form. Coming from a 
   place that lacked so many choices, where we were dabbling in things we didn't know were even things people would just do a a tiny subset of a field for an entire
   career, I have to say it still feels weird. I still feel like an imposter. I guess you can say that like my French friend, I am, at heart, still a hacker.
   Not a scientist, not an engineer, not an artist. All of them, while being none of them.
   
 ## And that's it
