- Monday

- Personal: 
- Came back from BayHac. I am exhausted, and sick. 
- Had a lot of fun and learned a lot. Specifically, the most interesting to me
- were topics on:
- -Adjunctions
- -Tensorflow Integration with Haskell API
- -Free Monads
- I would like to spend time for the rest of this year strengthening my knowledge of Category Theory. 
- I may have a mentor in mind


- Things completed: 

- Set up Blog with Liz via online chat
- Forked template, configured Git
- Updated file in markdown and see if blog works
