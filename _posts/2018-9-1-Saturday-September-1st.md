## Making Tough Decisions

## I'm currently House-sitting and Dog-sitting
- The great part is that they also have food (fully-stocked) and there's a washer and dryer.
  So I was able to do my laundry pretty quickly today. I'm probably going to do it again just
  before I finish this stint, too!
  
## Found a friend
- On a whim, I emailed a girl who had mentioned she was working on a Udacity mobile course.
  Surprisingly, she was really happy I asked her if she wanted to study data structures!
  So, we started studying on Tuesdays and Thursdays during lunch time! It really made
  my time at work brighter! We did the first bit of questions and I started porting
  our pseudo-code logic into Haskell. I believe she likes Ruby/JS/Python, so we are
  able to follow along, and we even looked at some Haskell solutions! :D
  
- Also, I'll be working under the big kahuna guy for a project. I like him a lot,
  and I think he's really motivational, so that's encouraging. I'll be the last point
  of contact before a release, too. I've never done that before, so it's interesting.
  My current supervisor seems to think I get things done quickly, and I feel like I've 
  been really slacking off :D I spent most of this week teaching myself how to write
  actual code in selenium in python instead of using the IDE which doesn't really make
  you write actual code. Because..writing code..is more fun.

## I got a call
 - From two companies I'd love to work for. If I said which they were, you'd probably
   throw rocks at me, so I won't do that.
   However, I spoke with my mentor and he advised
   against it, and said I should, instead, focus on learning for now. So I have to let
   the opportunities to apply go. However, I am still applying for summer internships for
   next year, because why not.
   
## This morning
- I also booked my GRE for Sept 19th and asked for recommendations. I think I may re-write
  my statement of purpose for the third time this weekend. Oh, and I cleaned up and made
  a new resume for my Phd applications that is more suitable for that, based on a template
  of a current student I am friend with who I admire. I narrowed down my list to six schools.
  They're really the *only* schools I'm interested in applying to for Fall. If I don't get
  into any, well, we'll cross that bridge when we get there. But for now, I'm giving it my all.
  
## And..back to work
 - I spent yesterday evening starting to look at Probabilistic Data Structures. It's interesting
   that a lot of schools (undergrad, I mean) haven't latched on to this as a part of data
   structures / algorithms, but a lot of top schools like CSAIL and CMU have. I've seen it in
   the posters they've presented at ACM conferences. 
 - I say this because this puts a lot of schools at a serious disadvantage when solving problems
   with algorithms if they don't know about some of these methods; for example, when I was looking
   at solving unique sets for duplicates, my friend and I both immediately jumped to using sets.
   Then I saw Gabe's talk on Hyperloglog (it was in the context of Haskell and data science) through his
   time at Twitter.
   It's more efficient than using sets. I've gone back and forth with statistics so I understand a bit of
   it, so it is definitely worth integrating it into my learning while studying long-term. It's crazy
   that so many schools are sticking to basic data structures and algorithms as the only way to
   solve computational problems!
   
## Anyways
 - Back to work for me. I plan to spend the weekend working through understanding some of the concepts like
   Http and APIs in Haskell, and going through the browser engine tutorial in Rust. I've been making notes
   on my repo about it.
