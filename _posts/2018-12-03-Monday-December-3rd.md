## Monday at home

## I spent today mostly at home

 - Did laundry..check
 - Went to dentist...check
 - Did Haskell..check
 - I'm still *incredibly* fatigued. This flu has me a bit tired, so I gain energy, and then feel tired.
   Last week, on the way to work, I'd pass out both on the way to work, and on the way back. I'm still
   recovering. 

## I helped out a friend

 - My friend, Matt, runs the local GDG group. He had Dev Fest this Sunday, and then is handing over the 
   reigns to another wonderful lady I had the good fortune of meeting. I helped them set up, along with
   a PhD student, check in people who were registered, and stuff like that. I didn't plan on staying 
   until the end, but I did. I actually enjoyed the talks, as they were very diverse. 
 - One in particular was on prototyping from start to finish. Having spent some time in a company that
   made real stuff (we had a machine shop, did electrical wiring, testing, saw things blow up, test again,
   waiting on parts, shipping them out, crating them up, fork-lifting them into a 53' truck and having 
   people go out and teach companies how to use the stuff), I really enjoyed it. 
 - Oh, I also won a prize at a raffle (I have one of the devices already, so I gave my friend, Tina), and
   at the end, Matt gave the four of us gift bags for our time. I was quite touched that we each received 
   a pointer-clicker laser. As an aspiring PhD student, it was such a thoughtful gift (and for the other 
   girl, who was doing her PhD, too!). Even so, it's a gift that just said "go out and give talks!". I loved
   that. So positive and motivational!
   
## I went to class today and then got home and started on Haskell. 

 - In the middle of class, I received word from a friend that he might be moving to the Bay area. Not just
   *a friend*, one of my *best friends* from upstate New York, who moved to Boston. This makes me so 
   excited! He'll be in California around the end of January. I cannot wait to tease him about his accent.
 - I think he'll do *so well* in the Bay because he's intellectually curious. I miss hanging out with him.
   When I first moved to the West Coast, we would talk on the phone for *hours* about books and concepts and
   all sorts of things. He was fascinated by fractals when I met him, and was one of the few people I knew
   who used the Opera browser. Strangely, I use Opera currently, and it's my favourite browser. Life is strange.
   
## As for my error

 - I am still working through it. That's specifically in my makefile.
 - However, I was working on another instance error in Haskell and resolved that. I'm about less than 100 pages
   from completing Sandy's book. I know I will get back to it again, but I always do a first read-through of books.
   For example, I've read LYAH many, many times, and always go back to Hbook.
 - I also got "Mathematics for Programmers", Kun's book, in the mail today! It looks *wonderful*, but I'm not allowed
   to go through it until I've completed Sandy's book. Also, Little Typer is in the mail. That will probably come in
   tomorrow evening, while I am at my local Haskell Meetup learning about QuickCheck. One of the guys in our group is 
   pretty into Checkers at the moment.
 - Over the weekend, I plan to get into Dhall and see if I can work through it, without bugging Gabe. Fingers crossed.
 
## I think that's about it for me
