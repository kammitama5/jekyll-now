## GSoC and RustReach Day 10 and Team Support!

## There is a 120lb German Shepherd snoring about 5 feet from me
- She's adorable! She quite frequently leans into me and wants me to pat her on the butt!

## I got up at 3:45am
- I think..I don't recall. My eyes were red. I was tired, and frustrated. My internet kept kicking out.
  Fortunately, as I write this, the internet has gotten better. I was even able to have my GChat on it tonight.
- I got onto the bus this morning (I think it was the 6:15am bus) and just knocked out. I got up a few stops 
  before mine, and sat in the Coffee Bean shop below my part-time internship, and worked on some Rust. I'm now on
  chapter 11.

## By the time I got home
- Actually, let's back up. I left at 4pm, took the 4:17pm bus and there was crazy traffic. As in, I got to my location
  45 minutes after the expected time. So I got home about 8 minutes before my GChat with my mentors for GSoC. 
  They were really chill about it, as I was frantically using wifi on the bus to update them on what time I thought I'd be 
  home. It was enough time to change and feed my favourite dog in LA :D
- She followed me into the bedroom and immediately tripped on my AC plug for my Ubuntu laptop and sent it almost flying.
  I anticipated that, though, so all was well. I guess she was just really happy to see me. So naturally, I had to spend a 
  good half an hour playing with her. When I've stayed up late working, she stays witihn reach and will often fall asleep.
  She hates photos, though, so you have to sneak up on her. Otherwise, she'll run away when she sees the camera. Kind of 
  makes sense now that I think about it; her owner is a well-known cinematographer :D It never occurred to me before; he's 
  a good friend of mine and his brother is sort of a legendary child star. But I just dog-sit :D
  
## We have a Banh-Mi Truck at work tomorrow
- I'm really looking forward to seeing the mad dash for that. I think I found out today that we have about 167 engineers
  in our building. The company occupies the 5th, 9th, 10th and 11th floors. They've also been supportive of me. Today,
  I put a dollar into the vending machine for some cheesy popcorn, and it (the popcorn) just sat there. LOL. I swear..
  ordinarily it works..but just not that pack of popcorn..today. I've been told I can call someone to get a refund, but
  right now, I just think it's funny.
  
## Meeting my GSoC mentors.
- I learned a *lot* today. I was struggling in understanding quite a few things.
- In the past, I was filling in types based on the Constructor. So if I knew it had to return a bool, I could return True or False.
  However, I was now dealing with Data types. These were input by Chris, and it wasn't obvious to me what I should pass in the JSVal
  function. Even moreso, I couldn't understand why the base arguments seemed to come last.
- Gabe gave a [great explanation on Github](https://github.com/google/codeworld/pull/640) and Chris explained to me in detail
  why in currying, it's better to have the base function *last*. And it makes *sense*. 

## More Support
- Chris also was arranging to have a co-worker of his meet me next week to give me a laptop. Then he decided to just 
  buy one for me, and have it shipped to me for tomorrow. I really really appreciate it. 
- It reminded me of when I was in Concept Design school (which led to woodworking,
  welding, machining, robotics and then programming), and I felt so alienated from the students initially because 
  no one wanted to talk to me, so I'd sit up front. I was an anomaly and the teacher immediately took a liking to me, because
  he was a bit of one, also. They'd mostly speak in Korean and ignore me. I made friends with the receptionist, and she taught 
  me some Korean (specifically how to say "potato chips" LOL).
- I felt so alone that I would hang out at this restaurant (now defunct) and the cooks and the head waiter and the
  owner took a liking to me. So the people in my class wouldn't speak to me and I didn't want to hang out with them, and I would 
  be downstairs before class, and the chefs would feed me and make me all sorts of off the menu stuff (including goat cheese 
  shrimp quesadillas) and charge me all sorts of things (like a three course meal for $4) and we'd watch football together and 
  drink red wine. They'd even give me wine-tasting cards, to be redeemed at any time. I remember one particular time I had 
  *no money*, so I got some rice, and some read beans, and made that for lunch. But it was terrible, and I couldn't stomach
  so many days of eating that in a row and was about to sink into self-pity, and the owner of the restaurant ran into me and said "are you going to stop by? We owe
  you a meal!" They took really good care of me before it was bought.
- One day, I was having a five course meal, and drinking a bunch of red wine before class with the chefs, and watching football.
  My teacher came downstairs and looked at me with this feast in front of me and laughed and said "you're going to be drunk in my
  class!". The head waiter came up to him and asked if I was any good, and the teacher looked at him and said "she's very good; she
  just needs the right tools." And so, this statement has stuck with me ever since.
  
## So here I am now
- Learning Haskell, and that statement rings true again. I'm getting there. And maybe one day, I'll get to mentor someone, too,
  and they won't have the best tools, and I'll be able to help them. I'd come full-circle.
