# POPL (Sunday and Monday)

## Firstly
- I apologize for the non-blogging; I've been quite busy between 
  doing the last week's requirement for a course, finishing up 
  my Nanodegree projects and lessons and volunteering for POPL.
  
## My First POPL

- POPL is amazing! It's been really a bit of heaven for me!
  It's difficult not to become star-struck, but everyone is 
  *so* down-to-earth, and the quality has been excellent.
- I'm volunteering for Sat/Sun/Mon/Wed/Fri/Sat

- The ACM organizers were so happy for my help, I've already been asked
  if I'd like to also join them for [ICFP](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-2018). I think that's a "hell yes!" :D
  
## Saturday
- I came in the PM to help stuff swag-bags. We completed our task
  within an hour, and I met Racketeer Ben, from Northeastern University
  (who presented on Monday). 
- [Ranjit](https://ranjitjhala.github.io/) came by to help (even though he presented first the next day as
  a Keynote!) and I saw an envelope by [Guy Steele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_L._Steele_Jr.) randomly and went (in my 
  mind) omg :D
- We ended up (about a group of seven of us) going to catch dinner, and 
  having [black ice-cream](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/little-damage-los-angeles?select=CV45aVhHSiB1nkd38vU77g) and going to CVS and Walgreens :D On the way, 
  we saw a Bollywood music video being filmed and ice-skating. It was so much fun!
  
## Sunday
- I came in to do an 8am to 12pm shift, and found out the person sharing my shift 
  was stuck in Germany, but it turned out just fine.
  
## Monday
- Did a shift from 8am to 12pm as a Session floater (doing counts of people in each room), 
  and in between was a workshop assistant for the CPP track for one session (Antal's talk!)
- Our lunch volunteers didn't show up, so I ended up stepping in for that.

- After that, I went to [Bob Harper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Harper_(computer_scientist))'s talk, and then saw in between the break that there 
  was a shift open for collecting tickets for the CPP reception, so I chipped in to do that,
  getting out around 7:30pm, after a nice glass of white wine.
  
- The hotel staff has been excellent; they even brought us over food when we were working, 
  and gave us roll-up cutlery so we could eat at our desks if need be.
  
## So far
- I've run into [Erik Meijer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Meijer_(computer_scientist)), who was dressed *just like* he is
  in his videos :D
- I also attended this amazing lecture by Bob Harper, and saw 
  research done by [Stephanie Weirich](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/sweirich/)'s team (presented by Antal).
- I also ran into [Conal](http://conal.net/blog/)! He told me that he'd miss his talk if he could to go see Bob, too! :D
  He also promised he'd give his talk again at [BayHac](https://wiki.haskell.org/BayHac2018) or a local Haskell Meetup.

## Bonus: I get to wear this!

- It translates roughly to POPL is a part of LA.
  If you have a question, I can map it to an answer

# Notes

- I thought I'd do analog notes for this, as:
  - I'm tired
  - I haven't done this in a while
  - Not a lot of blogs do this, and the diagrams
    are more helpful drawn as they are right now
