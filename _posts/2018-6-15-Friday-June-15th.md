## GSoC and RustReach Day 33, race and 1st Eval!

## We won our race!
- By a long haul, we won our race. We smoked them! I was on jib sheets.
  Our next race is July 20th. I can't wait :D

## Sailing and Haskell builds
- Are probably going to make me an alcoholic LOL. After our race today, about six people ordered Dark
  and Storm-ies, which is a sailor's drink. I went for a glass of Zinfadel.
  
## First evaluation
- I passed! :D I'm pleased. They said that even though I was learning, I was a great communicator,  
  very enthusiastic and a hard worker. Sounds about right! And I'm going to keep learning Haskell! :D
- And so..I keep going!

## Other
- I helped a student debug two problems today via my Udacity mentorship. I also had my meeting today
  with Mozilla. It was awesome because there were compiler people there. I'm considering attending
  RustBelt, too, considering I've never been to Ohio. But we'll see.
  
## I'm really tired
- So I'm going to call it a night. I managed to get quite a few of the ```polyline``` and ```curve```
  type functions to work using a list comprehension that Chris spoke about during our meeting.
  But I was getting stuck on ```ColoredText```, so I need to work that out tomorrow.
- My spelling is deteriorating...so it's time to sleep.
