## 5/18/17 - Utopia for Geeks

## I'm at Google IO.

## Obligatory Computer History Museum visit
Here I am with Ken (left), a Xoogler, Robbie (centre), a Googler, and there's me to the right!
I also got a tour of Robbie's office. He's moving to another one in a month to Sunnyvale,
but he lives about 20 minutes away so he could bike to work!
