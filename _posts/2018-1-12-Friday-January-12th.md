## POPL DAY 3

- Today was a long but satisfying day.
  I ran into [William Byrd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHov3fKYqBA), and sat next to [Martin Odersky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Odersky). I got to speak with William a bit, and also [Dana Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Scott),
  who was at last year's LambdaConf. I also spoke with [Dr. Spivak](http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/) via email.
  Spivak gave me great advice, which was that I should continue to do what I enjoy and making things that can benefit people,
  and to keep learning. Very sensible. Another gentleman told me that a good scientist is both passionate and dispassionate.
  Basically, you have to love what you do in terms of what you are studying (or doing), but also be dispassionate enough to listen to
  and critically assess fair criticism. 

- So, I'm trying to get good information about the Master's process. I was also advised about seeking an advisor
  and about what a good GRE score is. I've also done some of the research on that on my own, too.
- I was able to pick up a few papers that were left for the student volunteers (like myself) to take home. So that was pretty
  awesome. 
  
## So...tomorrow..I have an entire day of Coq!!!!
- Yassss!!! :D
- Then, the next day, I go Whale-watching :D

Anyways....

## Notes from Today

## Generating Good Generators for Inductive Relations (L. Lampropoulos)

- Testing w/ QuickChick
- Conjecture : ```for all (x : A). Q(x) -> P(x)```
- gen: GA -> Q(a) -> P(a)
- Lemma STLC preservation:
  ```
  - forall (e1 e2: term) (t:type),
    [] |- e : t ->
    e1 ==> e2 ->
    [] |- e2 : t
  ```

## Why is Random Testing Effective for Partition Tolerance Bug? (R. Majumdar)

- Jepsen -> testing framework for distributed systems
- partitions into two blocks -> http://jepsen.io/
  - 1. General Random Testing Framework
  - 2. Randomly Testing Distibuted Systems
  - 3. Wider Context: Combinatorial Testing
- Probabilistic Method
  - Let G be the set of goals and P[random a covers b] >= p
  - Theorem: there exists a covering family of size p^(-1) log |G|
  - P[random a does not cover] <= 1 - p
  - P[k independent a does not cover b] <= (1-p)^k

## Ninjas in Training

- n ninjas in training. Complete if for every pair of ninjas,
  there is a round where there are in opposing teams. How many 
  rounds make the training complete?
- Naive(O(n))
- From Training Ninjas to Distributed Systems w/ Partition Faults

## A Bug in Chronos 
- A distibuted fault - tolerant job scheduler 
- works in conjunction w/ Mesos and Zookeeper
- A partition isolating Chronos from the Zookeeper leader can cause a crash
  (issue on Chronos) -> issue 513
- A partition isolating Chronos from to the Zookeeper can *not* cause a crash
  (issue on Chronos) -> 522
  
## Splitting Coverage
- Given n nodes and k <= n:
  - Number of partitions w/ k blocks
  - Number of sets of k nodes
  - Splitting a set with a random partition
- Effectiveness of Jepsen
- Paper has other notion of Coverage
- K, l Separation Minority Isolation
- Concurrent Programs - program = partially ordered sets of events
- Combinatorial Testing 
  - 1. Inputs w/ many features
  - 2. Values for k features

- merge multiple tables into one
- move columns from one table to another
- formalization of equivalence 
  - two databases: how do we prove them to be equal

## A Logical Relation for Monadic Encapsulation of State (A. Timany)
- Haskell ST Monad
- provide ML style mutable references
- a way to encapsulate or hide effects wing types
- System F mu with built in ST monad
- ST Monad -> ST rho tau 
- runST::(forall B . ST beta alpha) -> alpha
- for each type rho, ST rho is a monad, in the Haskell sense
- return::alpha->ST beta alpha
- (>>=)::ST beta alpha -> (alpha -> ST beta alpha') -> ST beta alpha'
- Informal claim:Haskell with run ST remains "pure"
- new STRef::alpha->ST beta(STRef beta alpha)
- runST((newSTRef 7)>>= lambda r. (readSTRef r))
- bad programs leaking a reference runST(new STRef 7) STRef beta N
- Launchury and Peyton Jones, 1994
- Introduces ST monad and argues informally for type-safety and encapsulation
- Moggi and Sabry, 2001
- Type safety for an instrumented semantic call by name and call by need
- For all C (null C[e] terminates ->(null, C[e]) terminates
- State-independence theorem
- If e can be executed under some heap h, then it can be executed under any heap h

## Logical Relation
- Binary logical relation
- contextual refinements -> soundness of LR
- Iris logic -> higher-order separation logic
- Kripke logical relation

## A region-based relational model
- untyped global heap
- cut into disjoint regions in the relational semantics
- the computation must be able to start from any region (including empty regions)
- semantics of the Effectful types
- current heap for l and rhs
- h (lhs) h' (rhs)
- region rho holds for h and h' 
- (h, runST{v} reduces {h2, w}
- then (h', runST{v'}) reduces to (h'2, w')
- we can update the logical state
- how we encode in Iris
- the future modality and IC triple
- the NN-logical relation for proving the hoisting refinements

## Recalling a Witness: Foundations and Applications of Monotonic State (D. Ahman)
- Monotonicity is really useful
- its essence can be captures very neatly 
  - Monotonic state by example 
  - Key ideas behind general framework
  - accommodating monotonic state in F*
- Monotonicity in program verification
- set-valued sate
- insert v; complex_procedure();
- assert(v element get())
- {lambda s. v element s} complex-procedure () {lambda s. V element s}
- Consider ML-style typed references r : ref a
- r is a proof of existence of an a-typed value in the heap
- crucially uses monotonocity 
- Recall a Witness -> introduce logical capacity (modality)
- and a weakening principle (functoriality)
- we add stateful introduction rule for witnessed and stateful elimination for witnessed
- Monotonic counters are analogous
- ML style typed references (local state)
- 
```
type cell = 
   | unused : cell
   | used : a : type -> a, cell
   (type contains type a, with value of a cell)
 ```
 
- LST actions: write, read, add new value to reference -> get and put operation

## Rustbelt (R. Jung)
- Research Process: verify claims mathematically 
- lambda Rust : core calculus representing a fragment of Rust and its type system
- Rust 101: No Aliasing and Mutation
- send -> pass by value
- push -> pass by reference
- fn Vec::push<'a>(&'a mut Vec<i32>,i32)
- lifetime a' is inferred by Rust
- mutation, no aliasing -> unique ptr
- shared borrowing &x
  - can share multiple refs by diff threads
- aliased mutable state: synchronization mechanisms and memory management
- Mutex : contains data in Rust
- Mutex has unsafe implementation but the interface (API) is safe fn lock <'a>...

## Lambda Rust type system
- Core substructural typing judgment
- Synctatic type safety
- [ T] own (t, v)-> ownership predicate for every type 
  - t is owning thread's ID
  - v is data in memory
- Logical Relation
- Type Ownership
- lifetime logic -> splitting ownership in time
- P => (&_full)^k x ([tk] -> P)
- before tk is alive and after tk is dead
