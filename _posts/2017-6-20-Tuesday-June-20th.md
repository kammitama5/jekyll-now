## A pop up I made a while ago (Edgar Allen Poe)

## What's this!?

- I actually made this in an engineering class years ago.
  My professor liked it so much, he wanted it, so I let him have it.
  
- It's a laser-cut pop-up based on a short story by Edgar Allen Poe.
  In it, he describes being caught in the midst of a storm.
 
- I really liked it, because his work is a bit dark, and I guess
  at the time there was a lot of uncertainty in my life.

## Why are you including this? This isn't code!

- Lots of **great** engineers draw from different things.
  I have a strange background, and often see things in different ways,
  so I just wanted to share a bit of myself. 
  One of my friends jokes that I "misinterpret everything". 
  
  You don't have to be one thing, and I think that being a well-rounded
  engineer means that you draw from different life experiences. 
  Btw, NASA actually *does* hire origami artists to help them engineer
  how they fit things into spacecraft. So yes, it's actually a form 
  of engineering/ thinking that's useful. 
  
- I spend a lot of time reading, and especially on the Internet.
  I'm drawn towards mathematics, good design, programming, and the hacker/maker culture.
  
## So..will you stop talking and just post some pics?

Sure thing!
