## GSoC and RustReach Day 11

## Today is the FIRST day I was well-rested the night before!
- I got up really refreshed this morning, but with a dog staring in my face, wagging her tail in my face (that's code for "I need a butt-rub")
- We had a food truck at work; it was a seafood taco-one, with lobster burritos and stuff. I didn't opt for any of that, but still cool!
- I've also been told the snack people come by tomorrow! :D

## It's been interesting
- I'm learning about testing and automation at my local internship, and doing two remotely that require more coding and development.
  So it's a really great perspective to be in as a new programmer interning.
  
## I got my new laptop! 
- I have to wipe the OS and put Linux on it! :D

## Rust
- I wasn't able to get around to that today, but will put in some time tomorrow

## GSoC
- I'm working on the Blank Constructor, and after that, will work on the Rectangle one
- Also, this weekend, I'll work on the Medium post :D

## Back to coding!
