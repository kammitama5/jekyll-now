## Haskell Triumph!

## I'm really excited
- I was officially offered a Haskell internship for next summer! I am *super* stoked.
  Okay, let's rewind. I was up at 2 this morning because I was worried about not getting up on time
  for getting to my GRE exam. I sat it, got a good score, but was so wiped out that instead of going
  back to work, I decided to go home. I was so pumped when I read up on my score (I had no idea lol
  because I honestly didn't study and even know the format of the exam )
  that I immediately booked another exam, because I'm really close to getting a score that is competitive
  enough for *any* school. Right now, I should be able to get into any of the ones I have chosen,
  but my score had me thinking today "what if...". If I did a little bit better, I might have 
  my pick. That motivated me, even though I really interested in a handful.
  But I'm going to try again in October because I'm up for the challenge! 
  I also am finishing up my Statement of purpose and will get on sending transcripts. I currently have
  four recommedation resources who have all agreed that they will help me, too. 
- So I was wiped out! I knocked out shortly after a final phone call, and woke up a few hours later to
  check up on my class assignment online (I have class twice a week, but am only required to be physically
  there on one day). I checked my email and saw the offer. I can't say I've hyperventilated a lot in my life,
  but this was one of those times! I was in shock. Tears just started streaming down my face, while I was 
  hyperventilating. I'm going to work really, really hard and continue learning and building things in
  Haskell. I can't believe how far this journey has taken me and I'm so thankful.
