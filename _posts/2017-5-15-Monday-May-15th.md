## 5/15/17 - Struggling in Learning


## Hooray

- I'm caught up on my homework!
- Wonk wonk...by tomorrow evening, I'll have more due! :(

## Shaders

- Started on Shaders today. 
  Man, it's a such a pain, but I'm learning a lot.
  Attention to detail wins with this one. 
  
## Heads up

- I have some errors to fix, but shouldn't be *too* bad.

## But...I fixed a few!

Ugh...how did I *not* see this before

## Other 

- Not much else for now. 
  Trying to get everything done before tomorrow tonight.
  Basically, when I get home (close to midnight), 
  I do laundry, pack, and three hours later, take a 
  shuttle to LAX. 
  
- Should be fun. Meeting up with two friends;
  one is a newly-minted Googler and the other is a Xoogler.
  I'm expecting some fun :)
