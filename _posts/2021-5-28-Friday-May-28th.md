## Mentors : Dr. Gladys West

## I was chosen as 1 of 2 students
- Today, I was chosen as 1 of 2 students to say words of Congratulations to Dr. Gladys West, for her NCWIT Pioneer in Tech Award.
- I kid you not, as I was listening to Dr. West talk about her life and accomplishments, I had to wipe a tear away. She is SO INSPIRING,
and humble, and persistent. I was so honoured to get to speak with her today. This memory will stay with me for the rest of my life.

## What's next?
- I have work to do for research, so I'm probably going to do that later this evening, and then work on my MSR work this weekend, too.
- But for now, I just feel really grateful, and happy. Part of my congratulations and a bit about me, as I was introduced to Dr. Gladys as one of two 
special persons that she had to meet, was to mention that a mathematician who works in using satellite remote sensing is one who encouraged me to grad school.
Even when I was being offered opportunities to go to work, he said adamantly, "you should still get your degree and go to grad school", and I am super thankful
for that. Who could have imagined all of these opportunities and experiences along the way? I could have never; not beyond my wildest dreams.
Dr. Gladys West is a person who viscerally expresses her gratitude and emotions, and it was so unexpected to see her so impacted by the words of congratulations.
I'm so thankful!

## But for now, that's about it
