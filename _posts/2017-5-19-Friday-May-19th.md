## Day Two: Machine Learning

## TIL

- I spent the bulk of the day following the Tensorflow/ Machine learning track.
  That's actually the most interesting thing to me. I also ran into two people
  at a booth within a department at Google (which shall remain unnamed)
  who thought I was really smart and were interested in possibly contacting me
  in the future. So I gave them my information. 
  
  One of the guys said it would take him a bit of time to get organized,
  but that he'd reach out to me. I'm happy for any sort of mentorship I can get at this point.
  And I'm going to keep programming. 
  
  There was another lady yesterday who also wanted me to meet another Googler,
  a functional programming junkie.
  
  So that was nice. It's really easy to talk to them, generally, and I like their sense
  of humour. 
  
  I felt so welcome. I'm definitely not worried about a job as much as I care about
  getting really good.
  
- I saw some C++ code. That was really nice :)

- I was so tired I took about an hour nap on the lawn, along with several other developers.
  It was worth it; the grass was so cool, and it was so nice outside. I got up refreshed.
  
## I got home late

- I went to the concert. It was great. Today was really great.
  There were Glow-in-the-Dark Glitter pens. 
  People had their phones up with lights like lighters.
  There were huge balls that lit up being tossed around. 
  
  Enjoy some photos.
