- I plan to complete the labs and also get my $200 credit as well tonight. 
 
- Another late night, but I'm also going sailing tomorrow :)

## Highlight of the evening...Lisp!

- I went to this AMAZING Meetup...the Bay Area Scheme and Lisp Group.

- I actually recognized some persons from Clojure Conj!

## They were quite generous!

- I'd like our Haskell group to meet, so I wrote a kind note thanking them
  for their hospitality. The location was Factual in SF.
