## Cloud, Lisp and a Broken Down Bus

## Hey Ho...to SF we go

- Well, that was my intention.

## So um...here's the story:

- I got to my bus, but the bus was a bit late, so the lady at the desk
  suggested I change my connecting bus to a later bus (just an hour later).
  This was perfect, so no worries.
  
- When I got to the connecting bus, we got on, and all was well, and an hour
  into the route from LA, the bus started overheating. The bus driver said 
  "sorry guys..and thanks for your patience, but I'm going to have to turn this
  bus around...I don't think if this continues we'll even get to San Jose!"
  
- No worries..we were down an hour at most. Hopefully, there would be a working
  bus once we got back to LA, and we could continue, just an hour down
  
## Or not...

- We got back to LA and the bus driver had had it. He said "I'm going home. Screw this!"

- So a bus of about 30 of us had no driver lololol.
  Frantically, the logistics guy for the station was calling someone, and he said it usually
  took two to four hours to find a new driver.
  
## It all ended well!

- We got a fresh new one, who was nearby, so it took him about 45 minutes to get to us...
  but it was already 4am.
  
- So we left around 5am, which was the time around which we would have ARRIVED in SF. 

## Good news

- The driver was in a great mood and kicked up the speed, and I got into SF by noon, 
  just in time for lunch! So a win-win! I thought everything to be immensely amusing! 

## So on to training

- Got my Certificate!

- I plan to complete the labs and also get my $200 credit as well tonight. 
 
- Another late night, but I'm also going sailing tomorrow :)

## Highlight of the evening...Lisp!

- I went to this AMAZING Meetup...the [Bay Area Lisp & Scheme Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/balisp/).

- I actually recognized some persons from Clojure Conj! The group was wonderful
  and smart! A lot of the group also has experience in compilers, which I think 
  ties in nicely with my group (ie the Santa Monica Haskell group).

## The Spread

- They had amazing food and I also had two glasses of red wine. It was a classy event with great company!

## They were quite generous!

- I'd like our Haskell group to meet, so I wrote a kind note thanking them
  for their hospitality. The location was [Factual](https://www.factual.com/about) in SF, which is on Geary and O'Farrell.

## In the end

- It was 100 percent worth it! 

- I learned *so* much, made some new friends, and may even be in a Googs video (wearing a Haskell tshirt! Haha!)
