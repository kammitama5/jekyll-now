## Hotswapping and Afterthoughts

## Got back from Haskell Hackers

- Hi everyone! I just got back from Sunnyvale. 
  I spent the morning doing an interview, and realized I was just burnt out.
  So I decided to rest for most of today.
  
## In terms of my issue

- I realized that the only thing I could do to resolve the issue with my friend is
  to drop out of the community completely. The more I found out about the individual,
  I realized that the person was toxic.
- What was worse was that it was starting to affect my reputation, in that I was 
  now being perceived as "crazy" and it was even implied by the individual that 
  I was a stalker lol. I know...hilarious, right? 
  It's very hurtful when someone you thought was a friend does this, because (at least I do)
  I hold my friends to a high standard. But at the end of the day, you need to associate
  with people who are positive and have values that match your own, or yours will be sullied.
  So I spoke to the mods about it,
  and they of course were on his side because I'm sure he presented his case,
  and I had been gone for two days (on a bus, travelling, with no wifi), but 
  then the mod started apologizing when I started explaining my side, and said he 
  felt it was more of a miscommunication, but it made me angry because I anticipated this,
  and was warned by someone with good judgment that this would happen,
  and I felt like it was better for me to not be a part of the community.
  I don't want this sort of stuff to happen again. I work too hard and I care too much
  about my future for it to be sabotaged.
- I feel a bit angry with myself for trusting this person. This individual has a history
  of abusive behavior, misogyny and unstable mental issues. Plus, he's also in a legal
  battle with someone else he was close with, which is a whole other drama thing. 
  He spends his day insulting people and is a negative person. I must have been out of my 
  mind to trust him.
  So yeah..it was bad judgment on my part to befriend and trust this person, become close
  to them, and not expect it would blow up at some point. Really bad. 
- That's my Catholic (actually Anglican :)) upbringing for you. Seeing the best in people.

## Moving forward

- There will probably be less FP; it's probably a good thing, because even though it is,
  I think, affecting my code and making it cleaner (one of the positives I heard today),
  I think it's distracting me from just learning a language.
- I also just really like C++, and people look at my resume and see C++, but I don't feel
  comfortable enough to test in it, which is making me test in other languages I may not
  quite be as good in, which is making me seem less competent. So I'm thinking just stick
  to two; Python and C++. JavaScript may not be a bad addition, since I already have to 
  learn it for my Nanodegree.
  
## The actual Haskell event

- Was really great. We went out for drinks and eats at Firehouse in Sunnyvale afterwards. 
- I took notes; it ended up being two presentations! Yass! :)
