## Continuing with Story

## User's Perspective

- I'm continuing with a User's perspective on how
  they might interact with the app.
  Also, this is bearing in mind that I don't own 
  a smart phone, so that makes me a bit sensitive
  to the fact that people *might* be interacting with
  this on their desktop. 
  
- It reminded me of the Google Assistant Voice User
  Research talk, which was really excellent,
  and spoke about the ways in which we would interact
  by voice with the device, and what is annoying,
  or intrusive, vs what is not.
