## John Hopkins APL and Flight Software Workshop (FSW)

## Hello from Maryland! 

- I'm staying at a really nice hotel about six minutes' walk from the South Campus of John Hopkins APL.
- The APL is the Applied Physics Lab, which is located in Laurel, Maryland.
- They're involved in all sorts of projects, particularly for Space.

- Here are some of the units (models) from their main lobby

## So....what's this FSW?

- The Flight Software Workshop (now in its 10th year) is a meeting of organizations
  like APL, NASA centres, etc, to talk about and present on Software for things like
  autonomous missions. 
  It started out small; literally a bunch of engineers sitting around eating a box of pizza, talking.
  Now, it's limited to 120 participants every year. 
  Anyone is able to attend, but for some strange reason, I was one 
  of only two students who attended. So it was pretty neat; I was surrounded by some really
  knowledgeable people!
  
## The first day

- We had presentations on CFS, which is the Core Flight System. It is NASA Goddard's baby. 
  I hadn't heard of it before, but it used quite heavily internally by many such centres.
  I've also heard that JPL sort of wants to do its own version...JPL..the rebel..haha.
  So since that's the closest NASA centre to me, sort of makes sense that I hadn't heard of it much :)
  There were quite a few JPL-ers there as well.

## Day 1: Demo Day

- The first day had a series of presentations on various projects using CFS. There was even 
  a simulation showing one satellite that joined another one's orbit, followed by two more.

- Also presentations on tools like CMake and how they are used. I was a bit confused by CMake
  and tools like Nix, so this, along with chatting simultaneously with people on Slack, cleared up
  in my mind a bit about what each tool can do.

## Demo Day

- After the day's presentations, there were some demos set up.
  One gentleman from Goddard Space Centre, Alan Cudmore, took 
  painstaking time to show me a Pi-Sat he built using a Raspberry Pi
  and an Adafruit board, and a camera, with 3D printed parts, 
  and how it interacts with his system
