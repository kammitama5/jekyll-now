## John Hopkins APL and Flight Software Workshop (FSW)

## Hello from Maryland! 

- I'm staying at a really nice hotel about six minutes' walk from the South Campus of John Hopkins APL.
- The APL is the Applied Physics Lab, which is located in Laurel, Maryland.
- They're involved in all sorts of projects, particularly for Space.
