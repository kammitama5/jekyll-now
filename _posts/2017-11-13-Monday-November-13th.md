## Hotswapping Haskell

- Jon Coens gave a talk on Haxl's GHC Linker system.
  These are notes based on a presentation he gave at [Haskell Hackers](https://www.meetup.com/haskellhackers/events/244525354/)
  
- He comes from a systems engineering background, which 
  I thought was pretty sweet, since that's what I was interviewing
  for on Friday, even though I had no idea what it was :)

## Their Rule Engine

- determines whether spam or not before touches back-end

## Rules of Real Engine

- Large: (supplies Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp)
- Needs to push frequently: 100 times a day
- Update Quickly: commit in live-time

## Why Haskell?

- Type Safety
- Logic Changes complexity

- He mentioned if they were using C++ they would have seg-faults all day

## Fast Updates 

- typically you'd use a statically linked binary
- GHCI concept as a server wasn't performant 
- GHCI was compared to Haskell's runtime by itself 

## Concept of Hotswapping

- should be able to suck in code the same way a bytestring or text is sucked in
- Hotswapping shared objects
.so or .dll where new version of binary is swapped with old one
