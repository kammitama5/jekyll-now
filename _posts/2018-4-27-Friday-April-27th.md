## Day before BayHac and a bug!

## I'm going up to SF to attend BayHac tonight.
- I'm pretty excited. My two mentors will be there! 
- I may sound like a broken record, but that's usually because I'm pretty excited.
- I'm listening to an Avicii tribute livestream and going through CodeWorld documentation

## And..I found a bug!
- Well, I think I did. And I know how to fix it, too!
- Maybe they broke it on spite to take pity on my n00bness! :D
- That's okay, too!

- It said a value was not in scope, and had a type of Number, so I put in a number in its place..and it worked :D

## I had to set up my CLA
- Basically, for Google Open Source projects, you need to sign a license that says it's okay to use your contribution.
