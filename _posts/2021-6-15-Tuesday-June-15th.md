## First Approved Pull Request

## Waking up
- Waking up to an approved pull-request is one of the best feelings! This actually happened, and it's amazing!
- It's like waking up to a great cup of freshly brewed tea! So hooray for tea and pull requests!
- Yes friends; it's been M-E-R-G-E-D.
- I will be posting more as we meet and I work through stuff. I believe the next part involves some research and design of the infrastructure.
- This distributed stuff is F-U-N. Parallelism for life lol.

## On another note
- This week has been CRAZY! Not only have I been getting up at 3am (yesterday I got up at 2:30am, but today I couldn't hack it because of all the stuff
going on today). I had a poster presentation, an interview and another presentation all in the same day. I barely ended up eating lunch, and was SO thankful
for (1) cancelling my late night Monday meeting (2) taking the early morning session off and sleeping in until my first 9am meeting, 
because I would have been wiped out, cranky and distracted.
- On top of that, in my usual awkwardness, I accidentally lost a video I had been watching and couldn't mute it, just before one of my presentations.
I began freaking out because there was no way I could imagine hearing a video of someone else giving a presentation while 
answering questions and while giving a presentation. So that was pretty funny and completely something someone of my level of general awkwardness would find
myself in. It was like being in a meta-meta presentation and yelling "help me escape!" from the inside. What if there is symbolic execution for this?
- Oh yeah, and on top of that, in the middle of a meeting, I got delivery and the driver was high or something (not untypical of my location), and dropped
off my food but was sending me a notification that they attempted to contact me but I didn't answer (there was no such documentation of any call or anything?)
so that they'd have to cancel my order if I didn't contact them within 20 minutes or something. Fortunately, they had left it outside of my location anyways,
so I did get my food, and even if they decided to cancel it in the system, I got my food and they could continue to be high while making deliveries and we were all good.
So yeah, a little bit of mini-scares today that made me laugh.

## So far so good
- My hump for the week is mostly done, and my crazy part of last week is also done, so things are a lot better.


## And that's it
