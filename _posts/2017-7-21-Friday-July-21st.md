## Next seven days...

## I have a lot going on

- Writing a proposal for a technical talk for submittal.
  It's for a functional programming conference (of course!)
  
- Continuing with my Nanodegree. I also was contacted about 
  mentoring some of my peers, for a chance of getting another
  scholarship. 
  
- I have a Project-a-thon. All weekend, people in our Nanodegree
  will be working together and helping each other on our projects.
  
- In the middle of that, I have to meet with my group...
  to discuss how far along we are in our project, and to 
  finish up stuff for our presentation the next Sunday.
  
## Next week

- I'm doing a speed-recruiting event, where there will be 
  20 employers or so. It's an opportunity to meet them, 
  and they can meet me, and if they're interested, follow up.
  
- I go to SF for a machine learning/ recruiting event. So how
  about that? 21 interviews in two days? :)
  
- Oh, and then there's DEF CON that weekend (upcoming). Yes,
  I'm going from SF to Vegas, all in the same week!
  
## Sailing?

- Yes, there will be sailing. Sailing out of Redondo this Sunday!
  Never did that before, so that should be interesting! 
  The crew looks pretty experienced, so it should be a learning
  experience and a lot of fun for me.
