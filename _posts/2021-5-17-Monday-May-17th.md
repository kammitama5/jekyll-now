## Week One RLOS

## This is my first Official week
- This is my first official week of [RLOS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/rl-open-source-fest/).
- I've been set up with an Azure box, and am currently working on building a distributed pipeline, by first running an Azure script remotely testing several nodes.
- So far, so good. Or not. I started by installing the ```azureml-sdk``` but realized that it was taking all day to install, and getting stuck, because it couldn't resolve
my various flavours of packages on my laptop. This was fixed by just using a ```conda env``` instead. Phew.

## Integration
- My contribution will eventually meet with the estimators library that is being worked on by my fellow contributor. Within a month, we will meet in the middle
so that our tasks will start to interact, but for now, I'm learning and getting ramped up on Azure. 
- The mentorship is very good! I've really enjoyed meeting our MSR mentors, and they've been really patient and very helpful. They also included some really good
resources for me to get started. They have said already that they're willing to help us "any time", although we meet regularly on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the
morning, as my fellow contributor is based in India (she's awesome and very talented!).

## Taking what I learned from my last Open Source Project Mentorships
- One of the things that was immediately useful was that in GSoC, my mentors told me it was a good idea to write things down. So I've already started to make
a detailed document for each day of my progress, taking snapshots and noting where I get stuck. This is also useful for writing documentation later on.
- Am I nervous? Of course I am! Knowing I will get stuck, feel super silly, and of course, always feel like I am behind is really humbling. But if I learn something
(I already have learned quite a bit!) I'll be happy. And I'll meet some nice people along the way, too. I'm also really excited! I really feel humbled by the opportunity to continue being mentored to contribute in Open Source once again.

## I will be writing more throughout the week
- Prepare for progress weekly about my failures, what I learned, insecurities, and all of that. Some of it initially may not be viewable because I'm dealing
with a lot of config stuff that is specific to my box, and I don't want to have the sensitive information for that readily available (for obvious reasons).
- But certainly as I continue to work on this and the project takes shape, I'll be writing more. It's also going to be *super* interesting working on this *and*
an internship at Microsoft, and doing a blockchain mentorship (which I will talk about in terms of the speakers and meetings as I can).
- I also met another lovely research scientist at MSR, who is on the programme committee for ICLR, as it turns out I'll be a DEI co-chair for 2022. That was awesome,
and I've left feeling very highly of all the people I've met at both Microsoft and MSR so far. But this is just the beginning!

## And that's it.
