## Last Day in Portland

## Here is a post of flowers! :D

- I checked out of my hotel and met with Nick and Jeena. I *love* hanging out with them!
  I swear...it made me want to move to Portland, because it's been *so tough* finding
  people to hang out with in LA :(
  
- Anyways, we went out for breakfast, and then went to the Rose Garden and then had ice-cream!
  I had pear and blue cheese ice cream split with honey lavender in a waffle cone. I just really
  have a lot of fun hanging out with both of them!
  
- As I was leaving, Jeena surprised me with a gift. I was really thankful, but it made me a bit sad.
  I hope I can get to hang out with them again! She's planning Bang Bang Con on the West Coast, so
  uh..heck yeah I'd go! (and over the weekend, too!).
  
## So here's my photo journal for today :D
- Please enjoy! I'm pretty sure this will go back to coding from tomorrow :D
