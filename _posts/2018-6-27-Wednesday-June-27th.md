## GSoC and RustReach Day 45

## I am rested today
- I actually feel great! I also really enjoyed my GSoC meeting tonight!

## My tasks, should I choose to accept it:
are to:
 - learn some Elm
 - become proficient in arranging shapes on the screen
 - make the slider draggable. Also, if the slider isn't in Simulation, I need to file a bug on that.
 
## Slider?
- Yep. We have a slider!

## Shazam!
- Pretty cool stuff. It's clickable, but not draggable, and there needs to be some text to show it's
  a 5x slider.
  
## So for the rest of this week
- I'll be working on the GSoC tasks. I'll also be spending Friday on Rust, but the rest is for GSoC,
  including Friday PM. 
  
## I've also been encouraged
- Chris encouraged me today to also apply for Summer of Haskell and other such projects. He said Haskellbook
  is good and all, but I get a lot from working on projects like these. I agree, and I've really enjoyed
  this experience. I never would have imagined my summer would be like this. It's very fun and I'm happy
  to spend the rest of my summer working on debugging.
- I was actually thinking about it from PLDI, and I may very well enjoy spending a PhD working on debugging tools.
  I'm really in love with this stuff. It's *so* much fun!
  
## A supervisor of mine
- We were talking today about what we did in our spare time, liked, etc and he immediately said "I can tell you
  like the compiler stuff!". People keep saying that. I do, but I didn't think it was *that* noticeable.
  Okay, maybe installing Stack and spending all my time in between assignments learning Haskell is *kind* of a
  give-away, but I *swear* it makes me better at my job. 
  
## So I guess...some Elm will be posted here soon!
- As well as any other progress in terms of the slider and playing with shapes on the screen. Pretty fun! :D

## PS Haskellinos and PureScripters, please do not exile me because I have to learn some Elm. Love, K <3
