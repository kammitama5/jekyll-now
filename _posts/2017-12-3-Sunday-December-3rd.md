## Autodesk and a PCB workshop

- Hi All! I'm back from San Francisco. 

## I got in around 5:30am
- I was able to solve one question in yesterday's Advent of Code, but didn't have time for the second part.
  Then. It was off to my workshop.
  
## Creating a PCB 
- Matt (@technolomaniac) has an applied physics background. His career is mostly in high-performance,
  high-precision components. He also knows how to programme, and is teaching himself React, while
  also writing software for tools in Eagle CAD and Fusion 360. 
  
## Notes
- Manufacturing files, fabricating bare board, continuity testing, automated assembly takes up 
  80 percent of time
- PCB board is a 18" x 24" is panel pre-clad with copper (top and bottom typically).
  One ounce of copper per square foot (1.4 mills thick)
  
- chemical etching via a bath, with a stop bath (like fixer in photography).
  Board has 16"x22" working area
