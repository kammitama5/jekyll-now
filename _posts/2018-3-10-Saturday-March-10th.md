## Fruits, Nuts and International Women's Day Celebrations

## Fruits

- I woke up early this morning and did some Haskell, because I knew my day was pretty booked. Got a few CodeWars problems solved.
  Still on easy for now.
- I was thinking about the talk from Friday, and what he had said about US students; how the same ones who goofed around and were sort
  of the smart alecs up to high school or even Undergrad end up doing remarkably well in Grad school and beyond. And that it's more 
  difficult for those who were "top of the class" at lower levels, because they were good at regurgitating, but at the higher levels,
  those ones who were considered smart alecs were the ones who challenged assumptions and produced some really fascinating work.
  That appeals to me even more, because I've been called a wise-arse quite a bit growing up. I did well in class, and was in the
  brightest (aka Science) class, but I wasn't at the top (as in, top 5 or whatever). But the teachers really loved me because of
  the same thing; the smart alec in me. I was the one who "rocked the boat".
  I was that person of great mischief. That's part of why I think I fit in with the hacker
  and FP community; there is a sort of childish curiosity and mischief. 
  
- Speaking of boats...I joined a racing group today :D

- Also..interesting story; I was having a meal nearby to Googs today, and there was a homeless encampment right outside. 
  It's more and more typical out here. So I got there early and stopped by a place for a cup of tea. The waitress came 
  up to me and served me, and said "I just wanted to say I really appreciate what you guys are doing." Uhhh....?
- Turns out, she thought I was with the people who were helping with the homeless people in the neighbourhood, because 
  I happened to be wearing a similar colour t-shirt as they had and well, I was the only person who looked like me in the
  place. Then she said that she felt horrible, being there serving people at twenty dollars a plate, when homelessness was 
  right outside and people seemed to not notice, and that it was like some third world country. Yikes.
  
## So, the actual conf

- Pretty fun! I finally got to meet the lovely Natalie and everyone was quite wonderful!
  
## Wait..where are the nuts?

- Oh, they're here too! On the way home, I decided to catch a bus, and we were all in a good mood, and the bus driver was 
  waving at the bar cycle (apparently that's a thing; groups of people cycling while drinking in a bar-shaped cycle).
  Later on, some guy started walking up and down on the bus and spat at the dude in front of him. The driver asked him to stop.
  Then the guy hits a lady one seat from there and walks over to the driver and socks him in the eye! So that delayed 
  the trip by 20 minutes, because the Paramedics had to show up and give the driver a check-up and we had to wait for another
  bus. Thankfully we were all indoors, because it was raining.
