## 4/13/17

## Today I learned:

- Watched a great documentary on Titan and Cassini, and some on Vesper. Learned about cryo-volcanoes. 
  I guess this is what happenes when you hang out with rocket scientists the evening before. :)
- Learned about Delta-v and the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation for calculating orbital maneuver. 



## Things to get done:

- C++ quiz will get done, and hopefully posting to C++ discussion board. 

- Equivalence lecture and quiz.
