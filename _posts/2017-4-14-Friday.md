## Today I learned:

- Rewatched Dustin Mulcahey's talk on "Lambda Calculus" from LispNYC group. Also found a neat online Lambda Calculator, but I have to learn the syntax :) ---> [lambda calculator](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~gongliang13/lambda/#firstPage)

![Beta Reduction](/images/lambda1.png)

- Watched a great documentary on Titan and Cassini, and some on Vesper. Learned about cryo-volcanoes. 
  I guess this is what happenes when you hang out with rocket scientists the evening before. :)
- Learned about Porkchop plots, Delta-v, the Oberth Effect and the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation for calculating orbital maneuver. 


## Random Kata: 
- If you fold a piece of paper that has a thickness of .0001m, calculate how many times you have to fold the paper to make the paper     reach the distance of the Earth to the moon.

```
function foldTo(distance) {
      
      var t = .0001; // thickness of paper
      var a = distance / t // total length -> distance / thickness => 3840000000000
      
      // check to make sure length or distance is a number above 0 
      
      if (distance <= 0){
        return null
      }
     
      else{
      // find the value where 2^n is less than total length, a
      for (var i = 1; i < a; i++){
        if (Math.pow(2, i) > a){
          var a = i;   
        }
      }
    }
     return parseInt(a) // returns 42
       
}
```

## Things to get done:

- C++ quiz will get done, and hopefully posting to C++ discussion board. 

- Equivalence lecture and quiz. 



## Notes on Equivalence:  

Let E1, E2 and E3 be any predicates whatsoever. 

## Commutativity 

- conjunction: (E1 AND E2) <=> (E2 AND E1). This is self-evident.

- disjunction: (E1 OR E2) <=> (E2 OR E1). This is self-evident.

- equivalence: (E1 <=> E2) <=> (E2 <=> E1). This is self-evident.

## Associativity 

In associativity, grouping is not important, so we can ignore the parentheses. 

- conjunction: E1 AND (E2 AND E3) <=> (E1 AND E2) AND E3. This is self-evident. 

- disjunction: E1 OR (E2 OR E3) <=> (E1 OR E2) OR E3. This is self-evident.

## Distributivity

- E1 AND (E2 OR E3) <=> (E1 AND E2) OR (E1 AND E3). This is like separating the two via factorization.
  so x AND (a OR b) ---> xa OR xb 
  
- E1 OR (E2 AND E3) <=> (E1 OR E2) AND (E1 OR E3). 
  so x OR (a AND b) ---> (x or a) AND (x or b)
  
## De Morgan's Laws (note the flipped signs upon expansion)

- NOT (E1 AND E2) <=> (NOT E1 OR NOT E2). Expansion. ---> !(x AND y) == (not x OR not y) 
- NOT (E1 OR E2) <=> (NOT E1 AND NOT E2). Expansion. ---> !(x OR y) == (not x AND not y)

## Negation: 

- NOT (NOT E1) <=> E1 (!(!x))

## Excluded Middle: 

- E1 OR (NOT E1) <=> T 

## Contradiction: 

- E1 AND (NOT E1) <=> F (cannot equate to True)

## Implication:

- E1 => E2 <=> (NOT E1) OR E2.  **This is still a bit un-intuitive to me. **

## Equivalence:

- (E1 <=> E2) <=> (E1 <=> E2) AND (E2 => E1) ( if x == x1 then x1 == x and vice versa)

## OR-simplification:

- E1 OR E1 <=> E1
- E1 OR T <=> T
- E1 OR F <=> E1 
- E1 OR (E1 AND E2) <=> E1 

## AND Simplification:

- E1 AND E1 <=> E1 
- E1 AND T <=> E1 
- E1 AND F <=> F 
- E1 AND (E1 OR E2) <=> E1

## Identity: (very useful knowledge for Monadic Transformations) 

- E1 <=> E1 

## Simplification: 

- (E1 => E1) <=> T 
- (F => E1) <=> T 
- (E1 => T) <=> T 

## Contrapositive (useful method of proof-solving. Learned this is Devlin's class! :) 

- (E1 => E2) <=> (NOT E2 => NOT E1)
