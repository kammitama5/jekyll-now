## Neat Googs Foo.bar Haskell Hack and OPLSS!

## Hi everyone!
- Thought since I'm a Haskellino and this happened to me about two years ago and someone did a Java version, I'd do one for Haskell!

## This is for if you'd like to try their programming challenges
- Basically, if you're a Haskellino and want to try Foo.Bar, Google's recruitment challenge, but you want to do it the Haskell way...

## Open up a browser
- I already have a Foo.bar from before, so I used incognito

## Type in "Applicative Functor"
- retrieve the first address for this Google search like shown below

## Copy and Paste that result into a new tab. 
- Click the first link. If this doesn't work, repeat the copy and paste into a new tab

## Eventually, this comes up

## Click "I want to play"
- See, it opens up the browser window with applicative functor search. Yay Haskell!
- You can see it sort of warped the image backwards, as my search term, "Applicative Functor", is now tilted.

## You have to log in using a gmail account
- Then, you can start to solve the questions in either Java or Python
- Wait..WHAT!? Did you just say Java or Python?

## YUP!

## Why this sucks
- We would like to be able to solve this in Haskell!
- I mean, since some persons it isn't even used anymore for recruiting, why not add a few languages
  that tend to draw *bright* people who are *passionate about programming?*
- OCaml, Racket, Haskell, Scala, Rust? 
- I mean, I *was* searching for "Applicative Functor", after all. 
- Plus, to re-iterate...they're potentially missing out on some 
bright candidates.

## But..what do I know..I'm just a student :D
- /shrug/

## In other news...
- I've been accepted for OPLSS!!
- My room and board is being paid for (which includes meals)
- I'm really excited!

## And...BayHac is this weekend! 
- That's all I have to say! I'm pretty excited about that, too! :D
