- In true "me" style, I always have fun with the messages.

  I did this one a while ago called "GnomeRave", based on a first-person shooter tutorial, in Java.

- I started also with adding a second ball, but need to work out the mechanics, etc for it.

- Strangely, I remember my brother making this when we were younger. He probably used Java. :)

- Oh, and the bricks were made in Paint, pixel by pixel, etc.


## Additional
  
- I may attend a really interesting talk tonight for Papers We Love, in my local chapter.
  My mom (I know...I'm ten :) ) doesn't want me to stay out too late, as I have a cold, so..we'll see.
  
  
## Things to get done

- C++ lab (with my partner). I believe it's another game! :)

- Logic class new week opened up. Excited. It looks like there is some Hoare in there!
