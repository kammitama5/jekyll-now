## In true "me" style, I always have fun with the messages.

## I did this one a while ago called "GnomeRave", based on a first-person shooter tutorial, in Java.

## I made the textures and stuff myself. 


## Breakout cont'd...What I'd like to continue: 

- In terms of the Pong/Breakout game, 
  I started also with adding a second ball, but need to work out the mechanics, etc for it.

- Strangely, I remember my brother making this when we were younger. He probably used Java. :)

- Oh, and the bricks were made in Paint, pixel by pixel, etc.

## Also some notes on Hoare -> Homework done today

## Additional
  
- I may attend a really interesting talk tonight for Papers We Love, in my local chapter.
  My mom (I know...I'm ten :) ) doesn't want me to stay out too late, as I have a cold, so..we'll see.
  
## Hoare

- Here is the Hoare paper referenced:
  [Robert Rosen: The Well Posed Question and Its Answer
- Why are Organisms Different from Machines](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~mikuleck/PPRISS3.html)
  
  
## Things to get done

- C++ lab (with my partner). I believe it's another game! :)

- Logic class new week opened up. Excited. It looks like there is some Hoare in there! 






## Personal:

- I have a little bit of energy, because I'm getting better, and that can be a dangerous thing for me because I like working...a lot.

- I also bought this neat book a while ago. It arrived and I hope a few people at PWL can see it, perhaps, tonight. 
  It's on Number Theory. It's called "Recreations in the Theory of Numbers", and it's by Albert H. Beiler.
  
- I am also bringing Haskell stickers tonight for my group. Woop!
