## GSoC and RustReach Day 37


## I have a roommate
- She got in around 4am, and she's from Texas. She's very funny and smart!
- We are both going to the M Carbin PLMW workshop. I am excited.

## Also
- Tested my function! If it exceeds more than 30 chars for now, it truncates, or otherwise returns the string
- It needs tweaking but at least it kinda works :D
