## Going to see my friend

- My friend, [Samy](https://github.com/samyk), is presenting at [JS.LA](http://js.la/) today.
  It's going to be at Google LA aka Google Venice.
  I don't really care about libraries in JS (neither does he, really). I am coming for the hacking!
  And..the robots!!!! 
  
## Katas...

## Battle of x and y
- You were supposed to do more of a A = 1, B = 2 
  type thing for this, but in any case, ASCII works.
  If ascii total in x > ascii total in y, return x,
  else return y unless both x and y are equal.

```
function battle(x, y) {
    var total1 = 0;
    var total2 = 0;
    var arr = []
    var arr1 = []
    
    for (var i = 0; i < x.length; i++)
      arr.push(x[i].charCodeAt());
    for (var j = 0; j < y.length; j++)
      arr1.push(y[j].charCodeAt())
      
    for (var c = 0; c < arr.length; c++)
      total1 = total1 + arr[c]
    
    for (var d = 0; d < arr1.length; d++)
      total2 = total2 + arr1[d]
      
    if (total1 == total2){
      return "Tie!"
    }
    else if (total1 > total2){
      return x
    }
    else if (total2 > total1){
      return y
    }
    return
}
```

## Find the length of a number

```
function digits(n) {
  var a = n.toString()
  return a.length
}
```
