- I'm a programming languages researcher and aspiring [boffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boffin). I also dabble in Data Science and Algebraic Geometry.
- Also a book junkie. Love Haskell, Hackerspaces, puzzles, making and sailing. 

### What's Unique about me
- I would describe myself as intellectually curious. I've taken classes in sculpting, drafting, 3D modelling, woodworking, electronics (low voltage/high-voltage/PCB-milling), welding, machining, and robotics (I also taught a robotics class weekly for about a year). I've sailed from [MDR](https://www.visitmarinadelrey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MDR-MDR-Anchorage-map-web.pdf) to Catalina Island, and to Newport beach. I like Haskell and programming languages in general, which I did not learn formally in school. I also worked in manufacturing for a couple startups, and understand the process of manufacturing real-world products (generating a BOM, 3-d modelling, ordering parts, bidding with client, etc). I believe that life experience/learning from failure is important.
- I see programming as a tool. I believe that coming from a different perspective is important in solving new problems in computer science, and I enjoy collaborating with people who are from various backgounds in research.

### Update (as of 2019)
- In Fall 19, I'll be starting as a PhD candidate in Programming Languages Research at the University of Vermont (my advisors are Dr. Joseph P. Near and [Dr. David Darais](http://david.darais.com/)). My focus will be on Data Privacy (specifically Differential Privacy) and Machine Learning. I will also be a TA for Data Privacy coursework (Python), as well as a Programming for Engineers Matlab course (Matlab).
- I'm open to Summer and Winter Research Internships, particularly as they relate to my topics of research, or Haskell in general, and I'll get back to you, even though it takes a while because I'm often really busy! :)
